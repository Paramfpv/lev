Improved Skin, Joint Health, and Regeneration

Oral collagen peptides are widely used supplements aimed at improving skin condition, supporting joint health, and aiding muscle recovery. Numerous studies confirm their beneficial impact on skin hydration and elasticity, joint pain reduction, increased bone mineral density, and faster recovery after physical exertion. Collagen supplementation is especially recommended for older adults, physically active individuals, and those with skin or joint issues.

Level of evidence:Good

Level of risk:Negligible

After ingestion, collagen peptides are broken down into amino acids and oligopeptides, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream and reach target tissues—skin, cartilage, bones, and tendons. There, they stimulate fibroblasts and chondrocytes to synthesize endogenous collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid, supporting extracellular matrix regeneration, improving hydration, elasticity, and tissue structure, and reducing inflammation and degenerative processes.

Level of risk:Negligible

Collagen peptide supplementation is generally well tolerated by most individuals, with side effects being rare and mild in nature.

Collagen supplementation is not recommended for certain groups due to potential risks or lack of safety data.

Typical dosage is 2.5–15 g per day (most often 5–10 g), in the form of hydrolysate or collagen peptides.

Powder, capsules, drinking liquid; often soluble in water or juice.

First effects on skin after 4–8 weeks, for joints and bones after approximately 12–24 weeks of regular supplementation.

Anytime, preferably with a protein-rich meal or after exercise.

Good synergistic effects with vitamin C, calcium, vitamin D, and physical activity.

What Not to Combine With

Avoid use with products that may cause allergies or ingredients that trigger food intolerances.

Regular Supplementation

Best effects are achieved with daily, regular use for at least 2–3 months.

Combine with Physical Activity

Collagen supplementation yields the most benefits when combined with resistance training or rehabilitation.

Choose products with hydrolysate or collagen peptides with high bioavailability; pay attention to the source (fish, pork, beef) and potential allergies.

Key takeaways:Oral intake of Bioactive Collagen Peptides (BCP) significantly increases hair thickness and follicle cell proliferation compared to placebo.

Abstract:The effectiveness of supplementation with Bioactive Collagen Peptides (BCP) on the health and appearance of the skin and nails has been proven in several clinical trials. The influence of BCP supplementation on hair, however, has not been investigated to the same extent. In this placebo-controlled study, therefore, the effects of BCP intake on hair thickness and metabolism were investigated. The study was conducted on 44 healthy women aged between 39 and 75, who each received a daily dosage of 2.5 g BCP or placebo. After a treatment period of 16 weeks, hair thickness was determined and compared with the thickness at the beginning of the trial. In addition, the proliferation rate of human hair follicle cells that had been exposed to BCP was examined and the results compared with untreated control cells. The data showed a statistically significant (p<0.01) increase in the cell proliferation rate of 31% compared to the controls. The measurement of hair thickness showed a statistically significant (p<0.01) increase in the BCP group compared to placebo. Over the course of the collagen peptide treatment, hair thickness increased significantly by 1.93 ± 0.42 μm (p<0.01), whereas a slight decrease in hair thickness of -0.99 ± 0.40 μm (p=0.07) was measured in the placebo group. This clearly demonstrates the positive effect of BCP treatment on hair thickness and follicle cell proliferation.

Key takeaways:Oral intake of 5g/day of collagen peptides significantly improves skin conditions and increases hair strength, particularly for aged hair.

Abstract:The effect of collagen peptides on various aspects of skin and hair physiology is known but needs further studies. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical changes in skin and hair after 90 days of treatment with oral supplementation of 5 g/day of collagen peptides. For this, 60 healthy female participants were enrolled, aged 45 to 60 years old, with the primary objective of evaluating the effect of the ingestion of a bioactive collagen peptides-based supplementation in the cutaneous microrelief, reduction of wrinkles, thickness, and echogenicity of the dermis, as well as in the mechanical properties of the hair using biophysical and skin imaging techniques. The present study showed important benefits in relevant skin visual parameters, dermis density, and hair strength with the obtained data. In addition, considering that the aging process affects the hair's mechanical resistance due to hair fiber thinner, the proposed treatment was effective for aged hair. In conclusion, the collagen peptides oral supplementation is essential not only for improving skin conditions but also for hair care once it significantly increases the mechanical hair resistance evaluated by objective measurements.

Oral Supplementation with Low-molecular-weight Collagen Peptide Improves Hydration, Facial Lifting, Dermal Density, Skin Desquamation and Nails: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, and Maintenance of Effect Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral low-molecular-weight collagen peptide (LMWCP) improves skin hydration, facial lifting, dermal density, skin desquamation, and fingernail roughness, with effects maintained even after off-intake periods.

Abstract:Background: Oral low-molecular-weight collagen peptide (LMWCP) hydrolyzed enzymatically is a fish-derived type I collagen hydrolysate with more than 15% of its content made up of tripeptides in the form of Gly-X-Y (X and Y are placed arbitrarily, but are often occupied by proline, hydroxyproline, and alanine) including 3% Gly-Pro-Hyp. LMWCP helps with skin hydration, wrinkles and elasticity via previous findings, has been recognized individually by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS notice No. 2013-30) as a functional food ingredient. In this study, to expand the scope of diversity in the efficacy of LMWCP, we evaluated hydration according to depth of the stratum corneum, facial lifting, dermal density, skin thickness, skin desquamation, and roughness of the nail plate surface. Moreover, the measurement timelines were considered including the early time intake and off-intake periods. Methods and materials: This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled for 14 weeks including oral intake for 12 weeks followed by 2 weeks of the off-intake period. Water content (depths of 0.1 mm, 0.5 mm), facial lifting, dermal density, skin thickness and skin desquamation were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks after intake of the oral supplementation and after 2 weeks of off-intake (+2W). The roughness of the fingernail plate was measured at 0W, 8W and 12W. Results: The test group saw significant improvements compared to the placebo group. According to each measurement result, the skin moisture (depth of 0.1 mm) and skin desquamation were improved after 2 weeks of ingestion, and the skin moisture (depth of 0.5 mm), facial lifting, dermal density and skin thickness were improved after 4 weeks. For all measurement items, even after 2 weeks of off-intake, the test group showed a statistically significant improvement compared to the placebo group. In the roughness of the fingernail plate, it was found that the roughness was improved in the test group after 12 weeks compared to before ingestion. Discussion: These results demonstrated that the effects of LMWCP appear in early-intake and are maintained even after off-intake. This study suggests LMWCP as a safe and effective ingredient for anti-skin aging in the nutricosmetic market targeting both internal and external beauty and health.

Key takeaways:Oral intake of specific bovine-derived bioactive collagen peptides effectively reduces wrinkles and enhances skin elasticity and hydration, likely by promoting extracellular matrix biosynthesis.

Abstract:Collagen products are widely marketed for skin improvement. This study evaluated the efficacy of VERISOL B in relation to key skin aging parameters. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 66 women (aged 35–55) were randomized to receive either 2.5 g of bovine-derived bioactive collagen peptides (SCPs) (n = 33) or a placebo (n = 33) daily for 8 weeks. Their eye wrinkle volume, skin elasticity, and hydration were objectively measured at baseline (X0), 4 weeks (X4), and 8 weeks (X8). Additionally, the SCPs’ impact on type I collagen, elastin, and proteoglycan biosynthesis was assessed in human dermal fibroblasts. The SCP supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) reduced their eye wrinkle volume and improved their skin elasticity and hydration within 4 weeks. After 8 weeks of treatment, the positive effects were even more pronounced for all of the clinical parameters measured (p < 0.05). The fibroblast experiments confirmed the SCPs’ stimulatory impact on dermal metabolism (p < 0.05). In conclusion, oral SCP supplementation effectively reduced wrinkles and enhanced skin elasticity and hydration, likely by promoting extracellular matrix biosynthesis.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral supplements with collagen peptides rich in X-Hyp or X-Hyp-Gly significantly improve skin elasticity and collagen synthesis, suggesting their potential for enhancing skin health.

Abstract:Collagen peptides enriched with X-Hyp or X-Hyp-Gly have demonstrated resistance to digestive and systemic enzymes, suggesting their potential for improved absorption efficiency and enhancement of skin properties. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of oral supplementation with collagen peptides rich in X-Hyp or X-Hyp-Gly on skin properties in a clinical setting. A double-blind, randomized study was conducted on 30 healthy adult participants aged between 22 and 30. Normal collagen hydrolysates were used as the control, and each participant received a daily powdered drink containing either 5 grams of collagen peptides or hydrolysates (n = 15 in each group) for a period of 42 days. Skin elasticity was evaluated using the Cutometer, revealing a significant increase in the intervention group's skin elasticity (R2 values: 0.86 to 0.92, P < 0.001; R7 values: 0.77 to 0.84, P < 0.001). Collagen synthesis in the dermis was assessed using the SIAscope, demonstrating a substantial increase of 30.67 in the intervention group, while the control group exhibited a marginal increase of 0.49. In vitro digestion and cellular transport models were employed to evaluate the absorption and transport of Hyp-containing collagen peptides. LC-MS analysis demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of small peptide oligomers below 500 Da in the CP product compared to the control group (approximately 70% vs. 50%) after digestion. Additionally, the CP product exhibited a greater uptake of peptides (27%) compared to the control group (21%). These findings highlight the potential use of Hyp-containing collagen peptides with a low molecular weight in food supplements for improving skin health.

Key takeaways:A nutritional supplement containing peptides, lipids, hyaluronic acid, and collagen significantly improves hair, skin, and nails, making it an important and necessary component of complete hair, nail, and skin care regimens.

Abstract:Symptoms of dryness in the skin, hair and nails increase with age, and with certain medical, environmental and physiologic conditions—affecting a significant portion of the population. Topical therapies can be limited by the skin’s inherent barrier function, and simply ingesting a balanced and varied diet may not be enough to prevent nutritional deficiencies. The authors describe two double-blinded, placebo vs. control clinical studies, including one 60-week cross-over study, on the effect of a nutritional supplement formulation on hair, skin, and nails. The supplement formulation, that contained peptides, lipids, hyaluronic acid, and collagen as its active ingredients, was given to participants in 20- gram oral doses once daily, and the results show the magnitude of its effectiveness. The data showed statistically significant improvement in nail cracking, nail brittleness, hair dullness, hair dryness, and nail softness after 8 weeks. There was a significant decrease in skin dryness over the same period. The crossover study showed that those receiving the supplement had statistically significant benefits for as long as 52 weeks, then when the cross-over was performed and the supplement was withdrawn, there was a significant decline in benefits. Of those subjects with more severe symptoms at the outset, 95% saw significant improvement in hair dryness and dullness, 85% in nail splitting and peeling, and 65% in nail hardness. The authors conclude that this nutritional supplementation should be considered as an important, effective and perhaps necessary component of complete hair, nail and skin care regimens.

Key takeaways:Collagen-containing cosmetic products improve skin condition and delay aging by reducing wrinkles, hydration, and TEWL, and reducing nail breakage.

Abstract:Collagen (CLG) belongs to the family of fibrillar proteins and is composed of left-handed α polypeptide chains, which, twisting around themselves and their axis, form a right-handed superhelix. In the chemical structure, it contains mainly proline, hydroxyproline, glycine, and hydroxylysine. It occurs naturally in the dermis in the form of fibers that provide the skin with proper density and elasticity. The review aimed to present the types of collagen protein, factors affecting its structure and its unusual role in the functioning of the human body. Also, an overview of cosmetic products containing collagen or its derivatives, the characteristics of the formulas of these products, and the effects of their use were presented. Throughout the market, there are many cosmetic and cosmeceutical products containing CLG. They are in the form of fillers administered as injections, belonging to the group of the oldest tissue fillers; products administered orally and for topical use, such as creams, gels, serums, or cosmetic masks. Analyzed studies have shown that the use of products with collagen or its peptides improves the general condition of the skin and delays the aging process by reducing the depth of wrinkles, improving hydration (in the case of oral preparations), reducing transepithelial water loss (TEWL), as well as improving skin density and elasticity. In addition, oral application of bioactive CLG peptides has shown a positive effect on the nails, reducing the frequency of their breakage.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral intake of collagen peptide NS, containing Gly-Pro and Pro-Hyp, significantly improves skin hydration, elasticity, desquamation, and wrinkling in women aged 30 to 60 years without causing side effects.

Abstract:Collagen hydrolysate, which contains bioactive peptides, is used as a dietary supplement for the refinement of elasticity, hydration, desquamation, and wrinkling of aging human skin. Here, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled oral administration study on the effects of a collagen peptide (CPNS) containing dipeptides, including Gly-Pro and Pro-Hyp, on skin wrinkling, desquamation, elasticity, and hydration. Our results show that an intake of 1650 mg per day of CPNS for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on skin health in a cohort of women aged from 30 to 60 years (n = 100). Compared with the placebo group, skin desquamation, hydration, skin wrinkling, and elasticity were significantly improved after 4, 4, 12, and 12 weeks of administration, respectively. In a safety test of CPNS ingestion, none of the participants showed any side effects during the clinical study period. These results demonstrate that the low molecular weight bioactive peptides contained in CPNS, such as Gly-Pro and Pro-Hyp, exert positive effects on skin hydration, elasticity, desquamation, and wrinkling.

Key takeaways:Oral intake of chicken bone collagen peptides effectively reduces skin aging in mice by promoting collagen synthesis, inhibiting degradation, and reducing inflammation.

Abstract:The effect of diet on skin aging has become an interesting research topic. Previous studies have mostly focused on the beneficial effects of collagen peptides derived from marine organisms on the aging skin when administered orally, while the beneficial effects of collagen peptides derived from poultry on aging skin have been rarely reported. In this study, collagen peptides were prepared from chicken bone by enzymatic hydrolysis, and the effect and mechanism of action of orally administered collagen peptides on alleviating skin aging induced by UV combined with D-galactose were investigated. The results showed that the chicken bone collagen had typical characteristics of collagen, and the chicken bone collagen peptides (CPs) were mainly small molecular peptides with a molecular weight of <3000 Da. In vivo experiments showed that CPs had a significant relieving effect on aging skin, indicated by the changes in the compostion and structure of the aging skin, improvement of skin antioxidant level, and inhibition of inflammation; the relieving effect was positively correlated with the dose of CPs. Further investigation showed that CPs first reduce the level of skin oxidation, inhibit the expression of the key transcription factor AP-1 (c-Jun and c-Fos), then activate the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway to promote collagen synthesis, inhibit the expression of MMP-1/3 to inhibit collagen degradation, and inhibit skin inflammation to alleviate skin aging in mice. Moreover, the skin transcriptome found that lysosomes activated after oral administration of CPs may be an important pathway for CPs in anti-skin aging, and is worthy of further research. These results suggested that CPs might be used as a functional anti-aging nutritional component.

Collagen supplementation - does it bring real benefits?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation can improve skin quality, increase hydration, delay aging, treat osteoarthritis, and potentially prevent cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract:Collagen is a protein and one of the main building blocks of our skin. It is found in bones, tendons, ligaments, internal organs, blood vessels, and the lining of the intestines. In our body, collagen enables the cohesion of tissues and organs, affects hydration, resistance and elasticity of the skin, reduces the risk of developing degenerative joint diseases. Its production decreases with age. As a result, more and more people are taking collagen supplements. It has been proven that doing so can bring many benefits to the body. Taking collagen orally can be an effective way to improve the quality of the skin, increase hydration and delay the aging process. Collagen peptides are potential therapeutic agents for treating osteoarthritis and maintaining joint health. Collagen supplementation may be an element of preventive medicine in the field of cardiovascular diseases. as it significantly reduces fat mass and increases lean mass, it also leads to lower LDL concentrations. A beneficial effect was also noted on hair and nails, as well as on brain function.

Key takeaways:Collagen peptides positively impact skin's collagen content and elasticity by increasing the expression of collagen, elastin, and versican genes in human dermal fibroblasts.

Abstract:Background Collagen is one of the major proteins of the skin and it is particularly important for its strength and resilience. Skin aging is a natural process that is characterized by the decrease and fragmentation of collagen in the dermis. Oral supplementation with collagen peptides has been clinically shown to have a positive effect on the skin condition. However, the mechanisms of aging-related changes synthesized by cells exposed to collagen are currently not well understood. Therefore, in this in vitro study, the mechanisms associated with collagen, elastin, and versican in human dermal fibroblasts were investigated after exposure to collagen peptides. Methods The effects of different concentrations of collagen peptides on cell viability and metabolism were analyzed. For gene expression analysis, human dermal fibroblasts were treated with collagen peptides. This was then followed by RNA extraction and DNA synthesis. Gene expressions of collagen type 1 (COL1A1), elastin (ELN), and versican (VCAN) were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, collagen levels were analyzed by confocal scanning laser microscopy using immunostaining. Results Collagen peptides tested in the study increased the expression of the relevant COL1A1, ELN, and VCAN genes in human dermal fibroblasts (p < 0.005). Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed increased collagen expression in the dermal fibroblast culture after treatment with the collagen peptides (p < 0.005). Conclusion These data provide cell-based evidence for the beneficial effects of exposure to collagen peptides on the skin’s collagen content and on the molecules that provide firmness and elasticity. This may support the hypothesis that collagen peptides are important for maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and skin regeneration.

Oral Intake of Collagen Peptide Attenuates Ultraviolet B Irradiation-Induced Skin Dehydration In Vivo by Regulating Hyaluronic Acid Synthesis

Key takeaways:Oral collagen peptide intake can improve skin hydration and reduce wrinkle formation after UVB irradiation by increasing hyaluronic acid levels.

Abstract:Collagen peptide (CP) has beneficial effects on functions of the skin, such as skin barrier function and skin elasticity, in vivo. However, there are few studies investigating the mechanism underlying the potential effects of CP in skin epidermal moisturization after ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation. In this study, we examined whether orally-administered CP affects the loss of skin hydration induced by UVB irradiation in hairless mice. SKH-1 hairless mice were orally administered CP at two doses (500 and 1000 mg/kg) for nine weeks, and the dorsal skin was exposed to UVB. The potential effects of CP were evaluated by measuring the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration, wrinkle formation, and hyaluronic acid expression in the dorsal mice skin. We found that oral administration of CP increased skin hydration and decreased wrinkle formation compared to the UVB-irradiated group. Treatment of CP increased the mRNA and protein expression of hyaluronic acid synthases (HAS-1 and -2) concomitant with an increased hyaluronic acid production in skin tissue. The expression of hyaluronidase (HYAL-1 and 2) mRNA was downregulated in the CP-treated group. In addition, the protein expression of skin-hydrating factors, filaggrin and involucrin, was upregulated via oral administration of CP. In summary, these results show that oral administration of CP increases hyaluronic acid levels, which decreases during UVB photoaging. Therefore, we suggest that CP can be used as a nutricosmetic ingredient with potential effects on UVB-induced skin dehydration and moisture loss in addition to wrinkle formation.

Key takeaways:Oral collagen peptides can increase the expression of keratin and keratin-associated protein genes in hairless mouse skin, potentially linking to the hair cycle.

Abstract:Oral ingestion of collagen peptides (CP) has long been suggested to exert beneficial effects on the skin, but the molecular events induced by CP on the skin remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of oral CP administration on gene expression in hairless mouse skin and of prolyl-hydroxyproline (Pro-Hyp), a collagen-derived dipeptide, on gene expression in a coculture of mouse skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Using microarray analysis, we found that oral administration of CP to hairless mice for 6 weeks induced increased expression of Krtap and Krt genes in the skin. Annotation analysis using DAVID revealed that a group of the up-regulated genes, Gprc5d, Sprr2a1, Krt27 and Krtap16-7, is associated with the development of the epidermis and the hair cycle. In addition, the presence of Pro-Hyp (200 μM) induced an increase in the expression of Krtap16-7, Krtap15, Krtap14 and Krtap8-2 in keratinocytes in coculture, partially resembling the in vivo result. The Pro-Hyp-induced up-regulation of these genes was not observed when keratinocytes were cultured without fibroblasts, suggesting that the presence of fibroblasts is essential for the effects of Pro-Hyp. Our study presents new insights into the effects of CP on the skin, which might link to the hair cycle.

Oral Supplementation of Collagen Peptides Improves Skin Hydration by Increasing the Natural Moisturizing Factor Content in the Stratum Corneum: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral ingestion of collagen peptides improves skin hydration by increasing the level of natural moisturizing factor in the stratum corneum, without affecting skin elasticity or thickness.

Abstract:Introduction: We aimed to investigate the effect of orally ingested collagen peptides (CPs) on skin condition and elucidate their mechanism of action. Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in 99 healthy Japanese women, aged 35–50 years. The subjects were randomized into 3 groups (33 subjects/group) to receive 1 or 5 g of CP or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Skin water content, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin elasticity, and skin thickness were evaluated before treatment and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. The level of natural moisturizing factor (NMF) constituents in the stratum corneum (SC) was quantified before treatment and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: Oral ingestion of CP increased the water content in the SC and epidermis and decreased TEWL. Furthermore, the NMF level in the SC was increased. However, skin elasticity and skin thickness remained unchanged. Conclusions: The improvement in skin water content following the oral ingestion of CP can be attributed to an increase in the level of NMF in the SC. Trial Registration: UMIN000030375 (retrospectively registered).

Number of 

Key takeaways:Daily oral intake of specific collagen peptides for 12 months significantly increased bone mineral density and improved bone markers in postmenopausal women with age-related bone density reduction.

Abstract:Introduction: Investigations in rodents as well as in vitro experiments have suggested an anabolic influence of specific collagen peptides (SCP) on bone formation and bone mineral density (BMD). The goal of the study was to investigate the effect of 12-month daily oral administration of 5 g SCP vs. placebo (CG: control group) on BMD in postmenopausal women with primary, age-related reduction in BMD. Methods: 131 women were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded investigation. The primary endpoint was the change in BMD of the femoral neck and the spine after 12 months. In addition, plasma levels of bone markers—amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) and C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX 1)—were analysed. Results: A total of 102 women completed the study, but all subjects were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (age 64.3 ± 7.2 years; Body Mass Index, BMI 23.6 ± 3.6 kg/m2; T-score spine −2.4 ± 0.6; T-score femoral neck −1.4 ± 0.5). In the SCP group (n = 66), BMD of the spine and of the femoral neck increased significantly compared to the control group (n = 65) (T-score spine: SCP +0.1 ± 0.26; CG −0.03 ± 0.18; ANCOVA p = 0.030; T-score femoral neck: SCP +0.09 ± 0.24; CG −0.01 ± 0.19; ANCOVA p = 0.003). P1NP increased significantly in the SCP group (p = 0.007), whereas CTX 1 increased significantly in the control group (p = 0.011). Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the intake of SCP increased BMD in postmenopausal women with primary, age-related reduction of BMD. In addition, SCP supplementation was associated with a favorable shift in bone markers, indicating increased bone formation and reduced bone degradation.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation shows promising results for joint health, but heterogeneity among studies limits the generalizability of findings.

Abstract:Introduction
Musculoskeletal discomfort is prevalent in primary care, with conditions such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis being significant contributors. Collagen, particularly type I, is a major structural protein found in connective tissues. The supplementation of type I hydrolyzed collagen has been investigated for its potential benefits in musculoskeletal health.

Objective
This systematic review aims to evaluate the current literature on the effects of type I hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on bones, muscles, and joints.

Methods
A systematic search was conducted in August 2024 using four electronic databases - PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and CINAHL. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews evaluating oral supplementation with type I hydrolyzed collagen. Exclusion criteria were pre-clinical studies, experimental studies, studies not focusing on type I hydrolyzed collagen, studies with beauty-related endpoints, studies that combined collagen with other ingredients, and unblinded, nonrandomized, and uncontrolled trials.

Results
Out of 4,246 articles screened, 36 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The study protocols varied in population, health conditions, and study duration. Studies focused on bone health faced limitations that prevent definitive conclusions about the effects of collagen supplementation. In contrast, studies on joint health reported beneficial outcomes, such as pain reduction, improvements in clinical parameters, increased physical mobility, and enhanced ankle function. The muscle health studies were inconsistent, with positive effects predominantly observed when supplementation was associated with physical exercise.

Conclusion
Collagen supplementation demonstrates promising results. However, heterogeneity among studies limits the generalizability of findings. Future research should prioritize standardized protocols and consistent outcome measures.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen peptides show potential as effective nutritional supplements for managing osteoarthritis and maintaining joint health.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Recent studies show that enzymatically hydrolysed collagen, the collagen peptide, is absorbed and distributed to joint tissues and has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial with collagen peptides isolated from pork skin (PCP) and bovine bone (BCP) sources was carried out to study the effectiveness of orally supplemented collagen peptide to control the progression of osteoarthritis in patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. Improvement in treatment was assessed with reduction in Western Ontario McMaster Universities (WOMAC), visual analogue scale (VAS) and quality of life (QOL) scores from baseline to 13 weeks (Visit 7). Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

RESULTS
There was significant reduction from baseline to Visit 7 in the primary end points of WOMAC and VAS scores and in the secondary end point of QOL score in subjects with PCP and BCP groups, while in subjects with placebo group the end point indices remained unaltered. Furthermore, all the score levels of WOMAC, VAS and QOL decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the study group compared to placebo group in Visit 7.

CONCLUSION
The study demonstrated that collagen peptides are potential therapeutic agents as nutritional supplements for the management of osteoarthritis and maintenance of joint health.

The effects of collagen peptide supplementation on body composition, collagen synthesis, and recovery from joint injury and exercise: a systematic review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen peptide supplementation combined with exercise improves joint functionality, reduces joint pain, and enhances body composition, strength, and muscle recovery.

Abstract:Abstract Collagen peptide supplementation (COL), in conjunction with exercise, may be beneficial for the management of degenerative bone and joint disorders. This is likely due to stimulatory effects of COL and exercise on the extracellular matrix of connective tissues, improving structure and load-bearing capabilities. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current literature available on the combined impact of COL and exercise. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, a literature search of three electronic databases—PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL—was conducted in June 2020. Fifteen randomised controlled trials were selected after screening 856 articles. The study populations included 12 studies in recreational athletes, 2 studies in elderly participants and 1 in untrained pre-menopausal women. Study outcomes were categorised into four topics: (i) joint pain and recovery from joint injuries, (ii) body composition, (iii) muscle soreness and recovery from exercise, and (iv) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and collagen synthesis. The results indicated that COL is most beneficial in improving joint functionality and reducing joint pain. Certain improvements in body composition, strength and muscle recovery were present. Collagen synthesis rates were elevated with 15 g/day COL but did not have a significant impact on MPS when compared to isonitrogenous higher quality protein sources. Exact mechanisms for these adaptations are unclear, with future research using larger sample sizes, elite athletes, female participants and more precise outcome measures such as muscle biopsies and magnetic imagery.

The Influence of Specific Bioactive Collagen Peptides on Knee Joint Discomfort in Young Physically Active Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral intake of specific bioactive collagen peptides significantly reduces activity-related knee joint pain in young physically active adults.

Abstract:First evidence indicates that the supplementation of specific collagen peptides is associated with a significant reduction in activity-related joint pain in young adults. The purpose of the current investigation was to confirm the efficacy of the same collagen peptides in a comparable study population. In total, 180 active men and women aged between 18 and 30 years with exercise-related knee pain but no diagnosed joint disease completed the trial over a period of 12 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to the group receiving 5 g of specific collagen peptides (CP-G) or to the placebo group (P-G). For the primary outcome, changes in pain during or after exercise from pre- to post-intervention were assessed by the participants using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). These changes were additionally evaluated by the examining physician by means of anamnesis and physical examination of the affected knee joint. As secondary outcomes, pain under resting conditions and after 20 squats were compared between the study groups. In addition, the mobility of the knee joint and the use of alternative therapies (e.g., ointments or physiotherapy) were recorded. The supplementation of specific collagen peptides derived from type I collagen with a mean molecular weight of 3 kDa led to a significantly (p = 0.024) higher reduction of exercise-induced knee pain (−21.9 ± 18.3 mm) compared with the placebo group (−15.6 ± 18.5 mm). These findings were consistent with the physician’s evaluation (−23.0 ± 19.2 mm vs. −14.6 ± 17.9 mm, p = 0.003). The decrease in pain under resting conditions and after squats did not significantly differ between the groups, as only a small number of participants suffered from pain under these conditions. Due to the clinically unremarkable baseline values, the mobility of the knee joint did not change significantly after the intervention. In conclusion, the current investigation confirmed that the oral intake of bioactive collagen peptides used in the current investigation led to a statistically significant reduction of activity-related joint pain in young active adults suffering from knee joint discomfort.

The Impact of Oral Collagen Supplementation on Joint Function, Muscle Recovery, and Musculoskeletal Health in Athletes: A Narrative Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral collagen supplementation improves joint stability, reduces pain, and accelerates recovery in athletes, with combined use of resistance training enhancing muscle strength, body composition, and recovery markers.

Abstract:The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effects of oral collagen supplementation on joint function, muscle recovery, and overall musculoskeletal health in athletes. Collagen, a key protein in the body, is essential for the health of joints, muscles, and connective tissues. As collagen production declines with age, supplementation has become a promising strategy for improving athletic performance and reducing injury risk. This review analysed recent studies published from 2016 onwards, focusing on the impact of collagen supplementation, particularly in combination with regular training. The research involved a comprehensive literature search in the MEDLINE database, initially identifying 82 records, with 39 undergoing quality assessment. Ultimately, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The findings indicate that collagen peptides significantly enhance joint stability, reduce pain, and accelerate recovery from injuries such as Achilles tendinopathy. Moreover, collagen supplementation combined with resistance training was shown to improve muscle strength, body composition, and recovery markers more effectively than training alone. The review also highlights collagen's role in extracellular matrix remodelling and anti-inflammatory responses, offering potential benefits in tissue repair and injury prevention. These results suggest that collagen supplementation could be a valuable addition to athletes' training regimens, warranting further research to optimize dosing strategies and explore its mechanisms of action.

Assessment of effectiveness of oral administration of collagen peptide on bone metabolism in growing and mature rats

Number of 

Key takeaways:Orally administered collagen peptide may improve bone metabolism in growing and mature rats, especially in calcium-deficient conditions, without obvious undesirable effects.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of collagen peptide intake on bone metabolism in growing (G) and calcium-deficient mature (M) rats. As for the dosages used, they were amounts equal to the recommended supplements for humans (0.166 g/kg body weight (BW) per day: Coll-1G and Coll-1M groups), 10-fold higher (1.66 g/kg BW per day: Coll-10G and Coll-10M groups), and 100-fold higher (16.6 g/kg BW per day: Coll-100G group). In growing male rats, bone mineral density (BMD) of the femur in the Coll-100G group was significantly higher than that in the other groups after the 4-week experimental period. On the other hand, kidneys in the rats from the Coll-100G group exhibited hypertrophy. To examine the effects of collagen peptide on bone metabolism in a calcium-deficient status, mature female rats were fed a 0.01% Ca diet for 9 weeks and then fed a diet with 0.2% calcium with or without collagen peptide (control, Coll-1M, and Coll-10M groups) or a 0.5% calcium diet (normal Ca) for 8 weeks. BMD of the whole femur in the Coll-10M group was significantly higher than that in the control and Coll-1M groups, and the level was similar to that in the normal Ca group. BMD of the lumbar spine in the Coll-10M group was significantly higher than their baseline value, as well as being significantly higher than that in the control and Coll-1M groups. These results suggest that orally administered collagen peptide may provide beneficial effects on bone metabolism, especially in the calcium-deficient condition, without obvious undesirable effects.

Comparative Analysis of Collagen Supplementation Forms and Their Effects on Multiple Health Parameters

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation, particularly hydrolyzed collagen peptides, offers significant therapeutic potential for improving skin, joint, and musculoskeletal health.

Abstract:Collagen, a key structural protein, is essential for maintaining the integrity of connective tissues such as skin, cartilage, tendons, bones. As natural collagen production decreases with age and is further compromised by environmental factors such as UV radiation and poor diet, collagen degradation accelerates, leading to conditions like wrinkles, joint stiffness, and decreased bone density. Collagen supplementation has gained widespread attention as a therapeutic intervention to counteract these effects. This review conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various forms of collagen supplementation, including hydrolyzed collagen, undenatured collagen, and gelatin, and their effects on a range of health outcomes. Hydrolyzed collagen, due to enhanced bioavailability, is associated with improvements in skin elasticity, hydration, joint pain relief, and muscle recovery, making it particularly valuable for aging populations and athletes. Undenatured type II collagen, on the other hand, modulates immune responses and shows potential in reducing inflammation and slowing the progression of degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Gelatin, while less bioavailable than hydrolyzed collagen, still supports skin and joint health when taken in larger quantities. This review also explores emerging evidence of collagen’s beneficial effects on bone density, wound healing, and hair health, with marine-derived collagen showing promise in skin health due to its rapid absorption. Potential adverse effects, including mild gastrointestinal discomfort and rare allergic reactions, are discussed, emphasizing the importance of sourcing high-quality products. Overall, collagen supplementation, particularly hydrolyzed collagen peptides, offers significant therapeutic potential for improving skin, joint, and musculoskeletal health, but further research is required to define optimal dosages, formulations, and long-term safety for various populations.

The effects of collagen peptides on muscle damage, inflammation and bone turnover following exercise: a randomized, controlled trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen peptides moderately improve recovery of countermovement jumps and muscle soreness after exercise, but have no significant impact on inflammation or bone collagen synthesis.

Abstract:This study examined whether consuming collagen peptides (CP) before and after strenuous exercise alters markers of muscle damage, inflammation and bone turnover. Using a double-blind, independent group's design, 24 recreationally active males consumed either 20 g day−1 of CP or a placebo control (CON) for 7 days before and 2 days after performing 150 drop jumps. Maximal isometric voluntary contractions, countermovement jumps (CMJ), muscle soreness (200 mm visual analogue scale), pressure pain threshold, Brief Assessment of Mood Adapted (BAM +) and a range of blood markers associated with muscle damage, inflammation and bone turnover C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (β-CTX) and N-terminal propeptides of type 1 pro-collagen (P1NP) were measured before supplementation (baseline; BL), pre, post, 1.5, 24 and 48 h post-exercise. Muscle soreness was not significantly different in CP and CON (P = 0.071) but a large effect size was evident at 48 h post-exercise, indicative of lower soreness in the CP group (90.42 ± 45.33 mm vs. CON 125.67 ± 36.50 mm; ES = 2.64). CMJ height recovered quicker with CP than CON at 48 h (P = 0.050; CP 89.96 ± 12.85 vs. CON 78.67 ± 14.41% of baseline values; ES = 0.55). There were no statistically significant effects for the other dependent variables (P > 0.05). β-CTX and P1NP were unaffected by CP supplementation (P > 0.05). In conclusion, CP had moderate benefits for the recovery of CMJ and muscle soreness but had no influence on inflammation and bone collagen synthesis.

Key takeaways:Oral collagen supplementation improves skin elasticity, hydration, and joint mobility, while reducing pain and increasing joint range of motion in osteoarthritis patients.

Abstract:IntroductionCollagen is a protein that has found widespread use both as an ingredient in cosmetics applied externally and as an oral supplement. This substance is obtained from a number of animal sources, including bovine tissues, as well as marine fish. The characteristic properties of collagen peptides, such as scientifically proven anti-inflammatory effects, activation of fibroblast skin cells, stimulation of synovial cells to produce hyaluronic acid, and much more make this type of supplement promising in improving the body's general condition and in alleviating the symptoms of many ailments. Numerous scientific studies have shown that supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen has a beneficial effect on both the overall condition of the skin by improving its elasticity, hydration level, and positive action on its protective barrier and on the musculoskeletal system, where, when combined with appropriately selected physical activity, it can help to reduce pain associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis and even increase the range of movement in the joints. Easy availability, user-friendly forms of administration, such as powders or ready-to-drink liquid formulations, and a low incidence of side effects make this supplementation highly beneficial for users.  Aim of the studyThis study aims to discuss the known processes and review the evidence supporting the beneficial effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on the human skin and musculoskeletal system.Material and methodThis article presents the current state of knowledge about the benefits of oral collagen peptide supplementation in various scientific articles. Publications describing the mechanisms of action and the effects of collagen supplementation on skin conditions and the musculoskeletal system, including recent reports in this field, were reviewed using the PubMed platform. The search included the keywords ‘collagen’, ‘collagen supplementation’, ‘nutritional supplement’, ‘recovery’

Key takeaways:Collagen peptides in calcium and vitamin D supplements may reduce bone turnover in postmenopausal women with osteopenia, potentially improving bone metabolism.

Abstract:Objectives: Collagen peptides (CPs) seem to exert beneficial effects on bone and may have a role as a treatment option. In the present randomized prospective study, we aimed to examine the efficacy, as expressed by changes in P1NP and CTX, and the tolerability of 3-month supplementation of calcium, vitamin D with or without bioactive CPs in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. Methods: Fifty-one female, postmenopausal women with osteopenia were allocated to two groups: Group A received a sachet containing 5 g CPs, 3.6 g calcium lactate (equivalent to 500 mg of elemental calcium) and 400 IU vitamin D3 and group B received a chewable tablet containing 1.25 g calcium carbonate (equivalent to 500 mg of elemental calcium) and 400 IU vitamin D3 daily. Results: In group A, the P1NP levels significantly decreased by 13.1% (p<0.001) and CTX levels decreased by 11.4% (p=0.058) within 3 months of supplementation. In group B, P1NP and CTX did not change. Group A presented better compliance in comparison to group B and no adverse events contrary to group B. Conclusions: These findings may reflect the reduction of the increased bone turnover in postmenopausal women with the use of calcium, vitamin D and CPs supplements. The addition of CPs in a calcium and vitamin D supplement may enhance its already known positive effect on bone metabolism. Clinical Trial ID: NCT03999775.

Key takeaways:Oral supplementation of specific bioactive collagen peptides (BCP) significantly improves gait and quality of life in dogs with osteoarthritis, suggesting its potential therapeutic use in both dogs and humans.

Abstract:Objective Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder in humans and dogs. Due to its chronic progressive nature, the predominant clinical signs after a certain point are pain and immobility. The similar pathogenesis allows conclusions to be drawn from canine to human OA. Current treatments are limited and often attempt to treat OA symptoms rather than improve joint structure and function. Collagen hydrolysates as oral supplements are a promising therapeutic option to achieve this advanced therapeutic aim in both species. The effects of oral supplementation were therefore investigated in canine OA patients. Method In a systematic, placebo-controlled, double-blind interventional study in 31 dogs with naturally occurring OA, the efficacy of oral supplementation of specific bioactive collagen peptides (BCP) was tested in comparison to the approved combination of the active substances omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E. The dogs were examined on a horizontal treadmill with 4 integrated piezoelectric force plates at the beginning and end of a twelve-week test period. At both points, the owners completed a specific questionnaire containing the validated Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) and the dogs were fitted with accelerometers to record total daily activity data. Results Only the oral supplementation of BCP resulted in a significant improvement of several kinetic parameters measured using a force-plate fitted treadmill, and the quality of life assessed by CBPI, while accelerometry was unaffected by the intervention. Conclusion The results of this three-month BCP supplementation study using objective measurement parameters in dogs with naturally occurring OA demonstrate an efficacy, suggesting the therapeutic use of BCP in canine OA patients and demonstrating the relevance of this collagen hydrolysate formulation for the treatment of OA in human patients as well.

Key takeaways:Collagen peptides are beneficial for bone, joint, and overall health, but proper regulation is crucial to avoid potential risks and complications.

Abstract:Collagen has been reported to be one of the most beneficial supplements for health. In this chapter, we will expand on this idea by explaining how collagen is naturally formed, including what its components are and why they are important to its function, and its uses in the body to show why collagen supplementation can be helpful. After this we will discuss the benefits of collagen peptides in detail exploring the different body systems that they effect, and conversely, we will discuss the complications associated with not being able to properly produce collagen and explore a few of the most relevant collagen-based disease states. Finally, we close with a discussion on the regulation of collagen including the legal, medical and manufacturing restrictions placed on collagen peptide supplements. These will include specific situations as stated by regulatory bodies like the FDA and what leeway health companies are granted under current rules. Additionally, we show what risks lie with the consumer as a "buyer beware" situation when purchasing collagen supplements for personal use.

Key takeaways:Oral administration of undenatured type II collagen shows promise in alleviating joint inflammation and pain in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, with high patient acceptance and minimal side effects.

Abstract:Abstract The increasing global aging population has led to a continual rise in the prevalence of bone and joint diseases, posing challenges to both the quality of life for patients and healthcare resources. Type II collagen, a pivotal protein for sustaining joint function, has gained substantial attention in recent years. The oral administration of undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) has demonstrated noteworthy advancements in tackling bone and joint diseases. This article presents a comprehensive review of the structure and extraction methods of UC-II, discusses the relationship between UC-II and arthritis, and thoroughly examines its therapeutic role and potential mechanisms in the treatment process. In addition, future perspectives for clinical application of UC-II are discussed. It was found that the oral administration of UC-II, through induction of oral tolerance mechanisms, exhibits promise in alleviating joint inflammation and pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This method can significantly ameliorate joint inflammation and pain, with high patient acceptance and minimal side effects, demonstrating its potential as a well-tolerated treatment option for joint diseases.

Key takeaways:Orally administered collagen peptides from bovine bone or proline can improve skin laxity, repair collagen fibers, increase collagen content, and normalize collagen ratios in chronologically aged mice.

Abstract:Collagen peptides (CPs) have demonstrated to exert beneficial effects on skin photoaging. However, little has been done to evaluate their effects on chronologically aged skin. Here, the effects of CPs from bovine bone on skin aging were investigated in chronologically aged mice. 13-month-old female Kunming mice were administered with CPs from bovine bone (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg body weight/day) or proline (400 mg/kg body weight/day) for 8 weeks. Mice body weight, spleen index (SI) and thymus index (TI), degree of skin laxity (DSL), skin components, skin histology and antioxidant indicators were analyzed. Ingestion of CPs or proline had no effect on mice skin moisture and hyaluronic acid content, but it significantly improved the skin laxity, repaired collagen fibers, increased collagen content and normalized the ratio of type I to type III collagen in chronologically aged skin. CPs prepared by Alcalase performed better than CPs prepared by collagenase. Furthermore, CPs intake also significantly improved the antioxidative enzyme activities in skin. These results indicate that oral administration of CPs from bovine bone or proline can improve the laxity of chronologically aged skin by changing skin collagen quantitatively and qualitatively, and highlight their potential application as functional foods to combat skin aging in chronologically aged process.

Key takeaways:Collagen peptide supplementation may help mitigate muscle stress from strenuous resistance training, but further clinical trials are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying muscle improvement.

Abstract:Background/objectives: The oral administration of hydrolyzed collagen peptides is a scientifically validated intervention for enhancing skeletal muscle health and performance. This integrative review consolidates the evidence supporting the use of low molecular weight collagen peptides (2000–3500 daltons) for their superior bioavailability and absorption. Our objective was to review the effects of collagen peptide or hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on muscle damage, recovery, and construction related to physical exercise. Methods: A bibliographic search was conducted in major English-language databases, including PubMed/Medline, using terms like “Peptides Collagen and Damage” and “collagen peptides AND Soreness Muscle”. This review followed PRISMA guidelines, with bias risk assessed via the PEDro scale. The inclusion criteria were (a) randomized clinical trials, (b) randomized studies in humans with a control or placebo group, (c) studies assessing muscle damage or delayed onset muscle soreness via physiological markers or strength performance tests, and (d) studies using hydrolyzed collagen or collagen peptides. Results: Initially, 752 articles were identified. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including duplicate removal, eight articles with 286 participants were included. Of these, 130 participants received collagen peptide supplementation, while 171 received a placebo or control. Conclusion: This integrative review supports the potential of collagen peptide supplementation to mitigate muscle stress from acute strenuous resistance training. However, due to the methodological heterogeneity among the studies, further clinical trials are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying muscle improvement with collagen supplementation.

Evaluation of the effect of oral administration of collagen peptides on an experimental rat osteoarthritis model

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral administration of collagen peptides may have chondroprotective effects on osteoarthritis by inhibiting MMP-13 expression and type II collagen degeneration in an experimental rat osteoarthritis model.

Abstract:Collagen is an extracellular matrix protein present in the skin, tendon, cartilage and bone. Collagen peptides (CP) are produced by the hydrolysis of gelatin (heat-denatured collagen) by proteases and are utilized as a component of nutraceuticals. The current study investigated the effect of CP on the articular cartilage of OA by evaluating the serum levels of biomarkers (CTX–II for type II collagen degradation and CPII for type II collagen synthesis), histopathological changes (Mankin score, based on the toluidine blue staining of proteoglycans), and immunohistochemical staining of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 and type II collagen, using a rat experimental osteoarthritis (OA) model. Anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) was performed on the right knee joint to surgically induce OA. Animals were divided into four groups: Control group (Control), sham-operated group (Sham), ACLT group without collagen peptide (ACLT group) and ACLT group with oral administration of CP (CP group). ACLT induced histological damages and significantly increased the Mankin score (P<0.05). However, CP administration markedly suppressed the Mankin score, although this difference was not significant. In addition, serum CTX-II levels were significantly decreased in CP group compared with those in the ACLT group (P<0.05). By contrast, serum CPII levels did not differ significantly among the four groups. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of type II collagen and MMP-13 (an important type II collagen-degrading enzyme) indicated that the amount of type II collagen increased, whereas the number of MMP-13 positive chondrocytes decreased in the CP group compared with ACLT group. These observations suggest that CP has the potential to exert chondroprotective action on OA by inhibiting MMP-13 expression and type II collagen degeneration.

Key takeaways:Oral supplementation of specific collagen peptides combined with calf-strengthening exercises may accelerate the clinical benefits of a well-structured calf-strengthening and return-to-running program in Achilles tendinopathy patients.

Abstract:The current pilot study investigates whether oral supplementation of specific collagen peptides improves symptoms and tendon vascularisation in patients with chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy in combination with structured exercise. Participants were given a placebo or specific collagen peptides (TENDOFORTE®) in combination with a bi-daily calf-strengthening program for 6 months. Group AB received specific collagen peptides for the first 3 months before crossing over to placebo. Group BA received placebo first before crossing over to specific collagen peptides. At baseline (T1), 3 (T2) and 6 (T3) months, Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaires and microvascularity measurements through contrast-enhanced ultrasound were obtained in 20 patients. Linear mixed modeling statistics showed that after 3 months, VISA-A increased significantly for group AB with 12.6 (9.7; 15.5), while in group BA VISA-A increased only by 5.3 (2.3; 8.3) points. After crossing over group AB and BA showed subsequently a significant increase in VISA-A of, respectively, 5.9 (2.8; 9.0) and 17.7 (14.6; 20.7). No adverse advents were reported. Microvascularity decreased in both groups to a similar extent and was moderately associated with VISA-A (Rc2:0.68). We conclude that oral supplementation of specific collagen peptides may accelerate the clinical benefits of a well-structured calf-strengthening and return-to-running program in Achilles tendinopathy patients.

Collagen Peptide Supplementation and Musculoskeletal Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen peptide supplementation is ineffective in improving musculoskeletal performance in healthy adults when combined with exercise.

Abstract:Problem: There is a growing body of research investigating a variety of parameters affected by collagen peptide (CP) supplementation during structured exercise programs. The aim of this review is to focus on the musculoskeletal performance outcomes potentially affected by CP intake in healthy adults. Methods: A comprehensive literature search using defined MeSH terms was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO and Cochrane) by two independent reviewers. The resulting studies were used for systematic review and a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Two primary study objectives were identified, categorizing studies into those focusing on a potential effect of CP intake on adaptation to training stimuli and those focusing on recovery from training stimuli. Nine of these studies were used for in-depth meta-analysis. Of the 55 performance parameters extracted, 48 were unaffected by additional CP intake. Furthermore, the meta-analysis revealed no significant effect of CP on strength-related performance parameters (SMD=0.079 , p=0.445). Discussion: The studies included show a high degree of homogeneity in most methodological aspects and have a low risk of biased results, which supports the validity of the results found. Nevertheless, this result represents the current state of scientific knowledge. Conclusion: The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the available studies suggests the ineffectiveness of CP supplementation in addition to exercise to further improve musculoskeletal performance.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Peptide treatments show promise for soft tissue regeneration, with oral and intra-articular routes showing advantages, but both have limitations in bioavailability and absorption.

Abstract:Background: The musculoskeletal system, due to inherent structure and function, lends itself to contributing toward joint pain, whether from inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis, or trauma causing soft tissue injury. Administration of peptides for treatment of joint pain or inflammation is an emerging line of therapy that seeks to offer therapeutic benefits while remaining safe and relatively non-invasive. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to review the current literature on existing oral peptide agents, intra-articular peptide agents, and new developments in human trials to assess route of administration (RoA) for drug delivery in terms of soft tissue regeneration. Study Design: Narrative Review. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. The search included medical subject headings (MeSH) terms related to peptide therapy, soft tissue regeneration, and RoA. Inclusion criteria comprised articles focusing on the mechanisms of action of peptides, clinical or biochemical outcomes, and review articles. Exclusion criteria included insufficient literature or studies not meeting the set evidence level. Conclusion: The review identified various peptides demonstrating efficacy in soft tissue repair. Oral and intra-articular peptides showed distinct advantages in soft tissue regeneration, with intra-articular routes providing localized effects and oral routes offering systemic benefits. However, both routes have limitations in bioavailability and absorption. Still in their infancy, further inquiries/research into the properties and efficacy of emerging peptides will be necessary before widespread use. As a viable alternative prior to surgical intervention, peptide treatments present as promising candidates for positive outcomes in soft tissue regeneration.

Abstract:Collagen peptide can promote wound healing and is closely related to microbiome colonization. We investigated the relationship between collagen peptide, wound healing, and wound microflora colonization by administering the murine wound model with Salmon salar skin collagen peptides (Ss-SCP) and Tilapia nilotica skin collagen peptides (Tn-SCP). We analyzed the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factors (β-FGF), pattern recognition receptor (NOD2), antimicrobial peptides β-defence14 (BD14), proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8), anti-inflammatory (IL-10), macrophage and neutrophil infiltration levels, and microbial communities in the rat wound. The healing rate of the Ss-SCP and Tn-SCP treated group were significantly accelerated, associated with decreased TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8, and up-regulated BD14, NOD2, IL-10, VEGF, and β-FGF. Accelerated healing in collagen peptide group shows that the wound microflora such as Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, and Bacillus have a positive effect on wound healing (P<0.01). Other microbiome species such as Stenotrophomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonas, and Phyllobacterium had a negative influence was decreased colonization (P<0.01). All together, these studies show that collagen peptide could up-regulate wound NOD2 and BD14, which were implicated in microflora colonization regulation in the wound tissue and promoted wound healing by controlling inflammatory reaction and increasing wound angiogenesis and collagen deposition.
