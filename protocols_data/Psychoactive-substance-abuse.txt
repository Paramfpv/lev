Psychoactive substances affect the body through toxic effects on cells, induction of oxidative stress, disruption of enzymatic systems and neurotransmitters, and strong modulation of the nervous system. Alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, and other drugs can lead to irreversible damage to the liver, brain, cardiovascular system, and serious mental disorders. These mechanisms include, among others, chronic inflammation, impaired neurogenesis and repair processes, and the intensification of stress responses, which lead to a gradual deterioration of health and social functioning.

The abuse of psychoactive substances is one of the main causes of premature death and multi-organ health complications worldwide. Scientific consensus, based on numerous meta-analyses and epidemiological data, unequivocally indicates the highly harmful effects of alcohol, drugs, and medications used against recommendations. The effects include:

The abuse of psychoactive substances is a global health and social problem, with a growing scale in most countries worldwide. Key epidemiological data:

Seek help and support

Contact an addiction specialist, psychologist, or support group. Treatment is more effective when you use professional and social support.

Avoid situations and people that trigger substance use

Identify so-called triggers and limit contact and places associated with substance abuse. Surround yourself with people who support a healthy lifestyle.

Take care of routine and healthy habits

Introduce a regular daily routine, take care of sleep, physical activity, and a balanced diet – this helps reduce the urge to use substances.

Establish a crisis action plan

Have a prepared plan of action in case of a strong urge to use a substance – e.g., contact a support person, relaxation techniques, alternative activities.

Don't give up after setbacks

Relapses are part of the recovery process. If a setback happens, treat it as an experience and look for new ways of support.

The abuse of psychoactive substances has a clearly negative effect on the liver – it can lead to damage, fatty degeneration, inflammation, cirrhosis, and even liver failure. Different substances have toxic effects on the liver through various mechanisms. The risk increases with simultaneous use of several substances and in the case of coexisting viral infections (e.g., HCV).

Final comment:The abuse of psychoactive substances such as alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, and their combinations is one of the best-studied negative health factors. The effects include severe and often irreversible damage to the liver, brain, and mental health, which has been repeatedly documented in numerous meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and large observational studies. Scientific consensus indicates that the risk of organ damage, permanent neurobiological changes, and the development of mental disorders increases with the intensity and duration of exposure. Additionally, epidemiological studies clearly confirm that even moderate exposure to some substances (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, opiates) significantly increases the risk of chronic diseases, reduced quality of life, and mortality. The evidence is consistent and comes from both clinical and population studies, covering different age and population groups. The high level of harm results from confirmed multi-organ complications and the negative impact on mental, social, and family health.

Liver disorders in substance abusers

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance abuse disorders can lead to various liver disorders, including hepatitis, liver failure, and cirrhosis, with alcohol being the most common agent responsible for liver damage.

Abstract:Substance use disorders are a global health problem with detrimental effects on one’s health, wealth, and stealth. It includes the use of prescribed medications or the use of illicit drugs in excess amounts or for excess durations associated with complex neuropsychiatric and/or physical manifestations. It affects every organ in the body, and the liver is no exception to the deleterious effects of substance abuse. The mechanism of liver injury varies from agent to agent and may include direct toxic effects, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. The hepatic involvement ranges from asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation and fatty liver disease to hepatitis, liver failure, and cirrhosis. Alcohol, the most frequent agent implicated in substance use disorder, is also a prototype hepatotoxin, capable of inducing the whole spectrum of liver diseases. Cigarette smoke contains numerous harmful chemicals, including carcinogens, which can induce liver injury, fibrosis, and HCC. Cocaine, particularly in acute overdose, can result in ischemic hepato-necrosis, while it can also result in clinically inapparent transaminasemia. Marijuana and opiates, despite being associated with numerous deleterious effects, are rarely implicated in clinically apparent liver injury. Individuals with substance use disorder are also prone to viral hepatitis and hepatic insults secondary to hypotension, hypoxia, and other systemic ailments. Liver transplant candidacy in individuals with substance use disorder is a highly complex arena, with guidelines balancing abstinence requirements against evolving evidence on outcomes. This review article provides a thorough analysis of the hepatotoxic repercussions stemming from the agents commonly implicated in substance abuse disorders.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Amphetamine and captagon abuse significantly impact renal and liver functions, highlighting the need for awareness and interventions to mitigate health risks.

Abstract:Background. Addiction is a multifaceted brain disorder characterized by compulsive substance use despite harmful consequences. The physiological effects of drugs, such as amphetamines and captagon, on organ functions remain a significant concern, with varying impacts based on substance type and duration of use. Aim of study. This study aimed to investigate the impact of amphetamine and captagon abuse on liver and kidney functions. By comparing physiological parameters between individuals with substance abuse history and a control group, the study sought to elucidate the health implications of long-term drug use. Methods. The study involved 50 participants: 30 with a history of substance abuse and 20 healthy controls. It assessed liver and kidney functions using biochemical and ELISA tests to measure AST, ALT, ALP, Total Serum Bilirubin, Serum Albumin, Serum Creatinine, and Blood Urea. Results. The study revealed a significant difference between drug users and controls, with drug users exhibiting higher levels of urea and serum creatinine. Liver function tests showed increased GOT, GPT and ALP levels in drug users. Furthermore, total serum bilirubin was significantly higher in drug users, indi­cating liver impairment. Age-related analysis showed more severe renal and liver dysfunction in older drug users, with notable increases in urea and serum creatinine levels with age (p=0.001 and p=0.009, respectively). Conclusion. Both amphetamines and captagon pose a significant health risk to renal and liver functions. This underscores the need for awareness and interventions targeted at mitigating the health implications of substance abuse, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and treatment strategies for affected individuals.

Alcoholic disease: liver and beyond.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ethanol harms the liver, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract through direct and indirect mechanisms, causing atrophy and fibrosis in various organs.

Abstract:The harmful use of alcohol is a worldwide problem. It has been estimated that alcohol abuse represents the world's third largest risk factor for disease and disability; it is a causal factor of 60 types of diseases and injuries and a concurrent cause of at least 200 others. Liver is the main organ responsible for metabolizing ethanol, thus it has been considered for long time the major victim of the harmful use of alcohol. Ethanol and its bioactive products, acetaldehyde-acetate, fatty acid ethanol esters, ethanol-protein adducts, have been regarded as hepatotoxins that directly and indirectly exert their toxic effect on the liver. A similar mechanism has been postulated for the alcohol-related pancreatic damage. Alcohol and its metabolites directly injure acinar cells and elicit stellate cells to produce and deposit extracellular matrix thus triggering the 'necrosis-fibrosis' sequence that finally leads to atrophy and fibrosis, morphological hallmarks of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Even if less attention has been paid to the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, ethanol produces harmful effects by inducing: (1) direct damaging of the mucosa of the esophagus and stomach; (2) modification of the sphincterial pressure and impairment of motility; and (3) alteration of gastric acid output. In the intestine, ethanol can damage the intestinal mucosa directly or indirectly by altering the resident microflora and impairing the mucosal immune system. Notably, disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier of the small and large intestine contribute to liver damage. This review summarizes the most clinically relevant alcohol-related diseases of the digestive tract focusing on the pathogenic mechanisms by which ethanol damages liver, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract.

Substances use disorders and liver injury: a concise review.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance use disorders (SUDs) are associated with liver damage, and early identification of liver fibrosis is crucial for improving prognosis and long-term survival.

Abstract:Substance use disorders (SUDs) are often associated with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and psychiatric comorbidities. In addition, they are often subjected to polytherapy. For these reasons SUDs patients are at greater risk of developing liver disease. In this concise review, liver damage from amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine and opioids is analyzed and the need to identify a possible associated alcohol use disorder is also suggested. Early identification of liver fibrosis is required in SUDs patients. Fibrosis is the most significant predictor of both prognosis and long-term survival. Its identification helps to promote the abstention from substances and alcohol. Active use of heroin, cocaine and synthetic substances is an absolute controindication for liver transplantation. In cases of remission and adherence to a significant care path, the patient is reevaluated. An addiction specialist should be present within the transplant team. If this is not present, a close collaboration with an addiction unit is mandatory.

Key takeaways:Tramadol and other opioids significantly alter liver function and enzymes, while benzodiazepines cause cholestatic hepatitis in abusers.

Abstract:Background: Substance abuse is a worldwide problem with rapidly expanding prevalence. Liver is highly vulnerable to xenobiotics 
toxicities. 
Methods: We have investigated the effect of substances of 5 commonly abused in Egypt (tramadol, opiates, cannabis, barbiturates 
and benzodiazepines) on liver functions in persons attending to Mansoura university hospitals. After exclusion of cases 
with chronic liver diseases, participants were screened by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. Positive cases were confirmed by 
gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and examined by abdominal ultrsonography and live functions tests were done. 
Results: GC-MS showed only 125 positive cases. No abnormalities were detected by ultrasonography in the examined populations. 
SGOT, SGPT and direct bilirubin were significantly increased, while albumin was significantly decreased in abusers in 
comparison to nonabusers. Tramadol and other opioids were shown to be the most hepatotoixc agents. In addition, SGOT was 
shown to be significantly increased to less extent in tramadol and cannabis co-abusers. Furthermore, benzodiazepines were 
shown to significantly increase serum direct and total bilirubin. 
Conclusions: We can conclude that tramadol and other opioids significantly alter liver synthetic and excretory function in parallel 
to significant increase in liver enzymes among abusers. Moreover, cholestatic hepatitis was observed among benzodiazepine 
abusers.

Could Alcohol Abuse and Dependence on Junk Foods Inducing Obesity and/or Illicit Drug Use Represent Danger to Liver in Young People with Altered Psychological/Relational Spheres or Emotional Problems?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Alcohol abuse, junk food addiction, and illicit drug use can lead to obesity, mental damage, and liver damage in young people with altered psychological/relational spheres or emotional problems.

Abstract:Recent data show that young people, mainly due to the pressure of some risk factors or due to disrupted interpersonal relationships, utilise greater reward value and display greater sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of “pleasurable stimuli”, specifically in those situations in which an enhanced dopamine release is present. Alcoholic beverages, foods rich in sugar and fat, and illicit drug use are pleasurable feelings associated with rewards. Research shows that there is a link between substance abuse and obesity in brain functioning. Still, alcohol excess is central in leading to obesity and obesity-related morbidities, such as hepatic steatosis, mainly when associated with illicit drug dependence and negative eating behaviours in young people. It is ascertained that long-term drinking causes mental damage, similarly to drug abuse, but also affects liver function. Indeed, beyond the pharmacokinetic interactions of alcohol with drugs, occurring in the liver due to the same metabolic enzymes, there are also pharmacodynamic interactions of both substances in the CNS. To complicate matters, an important noxious effect of junk foods consists of inducing obesity and obesity-related NAFLD. In this review, we focus on some key mechanisms underlying the impact of these addictions on the liver, as well as those on the CNS.

Key takeaways:Substance abusers in Assiut have a high percentage of ECG abnormalities and a risk of hepatic damage due to infective hepatitis.

Abstract:Background: Substance abuse is a major challenge in Egypt due to changing pattern of abuse and its threating to health, social and economic build of the community. Aim of the work: the present work aims to demonstrate the pattern of substance abuse in Assiut governorate. Also to study the liver, kidney functions and electrocardiographic changes among addicted patients admitted to Addiction Management Unit of Neurology and Psychiatry Hospital at Assiut University. Patients and methods: the study was done on 80 male in-patients, who are addicted for at least one year and 41 healthy non-abusers. All Patients fulfilled a questionnaire of drug dependence and were subjected to a thorough clinical examination beside measurement of liver functions, kidney functions, electrocardiogram recordings, and urine toxicological screen. Results: Forty-three patients (53.75%) were 25–35 years of age. Their mean of age was 30.47±6.91 years. Multiple substance abuse represented 57.5% (46 cases) and tramadol was the most commonly abused drug. Tramadol was abused alone in 32.5% (26 cases). The technical school (47.5%) was the most common educational level. Family history of abuse was positive in 47.5% of cases. HCV was positive in 15 (18.75%) of cases, 13 of HCV positives cases used injection for substance abuse. There was no significant association between liver and kidney functions changes and addiction duration. However, a correlation was established between liver functions changes and infective hepatitis. There was a high percentage of ECG abnormalities among abusers (53.75%), those abnormalities were in the form of an inverted T wave in 13 patients (30.23%). Conclusion: This research shows that ECG abnormalities are frequently encountered in substance abusers. The results also point out the risk of hepatic damage due to infective hepatitis in injection drug users. Measures to control the spread of substance abuse should be implemented.

Alcohol and liver damage

Key takeaways:Excessive alcohol use, especially in high-risk situations, may strain the liver and contribute to various health conditions.

Abstract:Way to be proactive about investigating how substances can impact the body! For most folks, low-risk use of alcohol doesn't seem to damage the liver. The misuse and abuse of alcohol may have a long-lasting impact on the liver. The liver breaks down and eliminates toxins, converts excess blood sugar to glycogen for energy storage, and performs many other crucial functions. As such, excess alcohol use may put strain on the liver and may contribute to a number of health conditions, especially if used in a high-risk manner.

Alcohol-Mediated Organ Damages: Heart and Brain

Key takeaways:Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to heart and brain damage, with inflammatory markers like TNF- potentially predicting dementia and cardiovascular disease.

Abstract:Alcohol is one of the most commonly abused substances in the United States. Chronic consumption of ethanol has been responsible for numerous chronic diseases and conditions globally. The underlying mechanism of liver injury has been studied in depth, however, far fewer studies have examined other organs especially the heart and the central nervous system (CNS). The authors conducted a narrative review on the relationship of alcohol with heart disease and dementia. With that in mind, a complex relationship between inflammation and cardiovascular disease and dementia has been long proposed but inflammatory biomarkers have gained more attention lately. In this review we examine some of the consequences of the altered cytokine regulation that occurs in alcoholics in organs other than the liver. The article reviews the potential role of inflammatory markers such as TNF-α in predicting dementia and/or cardiovascular disease. It was found that TNF-α could promote and accelerate local inflammation and damage through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. Unraveling the mechanisms linking chronic alcohol consumption with proinflammatory cytokine production and subsequent inflammatory signaling pathways activation in the heart and CNS, is essential to improve our understanding of the disease and hopefully facilitate the development of new remedies.

S1548 The Effect of Cocaine Use on Patient Outcomes in Those Evaluated for Liver Transplant

Number of 

Key takeaways:Cocaine use disorder (CUD) negatively impacts liver transplant access, with a 2.2 x risk of being declined during evaluation, especially in patients without alcohol use disorder.

Abstract:Introduction: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Active SUD is a contraindication in most scenarios related to liver transplantation (LT). However, it is possible that patients with a history of SUD experience negative bias in LT. Currently, there is limited data on history of cocaine use in liver transplant evaluation (LTE) and liver transplant listing (LTL) outcomes. We aimed to analyze the effect of cocaine use disorder (CUD) on LTE and LTL outcomes in liver transplant candidates. Methods: We completed a single center retrospective analysis of patients undergoing LTE for evaluation over a 4-year period. Patients evaluated for CLD were included; patients with acute liver failure and prior LT were excluded. Substance use history was during the TLE psychosocial assessment. CUD was defined as current or prior regular use of cocaine. Outcomes of LTE included declined vs not declined for listing. Data was compared using chi squared and t tests. The relationship between CUD and outcomes was assessed using univariate logistic regression and further analyzed with a parsimonious multivariate model. Analysis was completed in SPSS software. Significance was determined as P< 0.05. Results: 678 patients were included, of which 96 (14%) patients reported current or past cocaine use. Usage was highest in hepatitis C cirrhosis (HCV) and alcohol liver disease (ALD) where 42% and 14% reported CUD, respectively. Patients with CUD were younger (P=0.01), had a lower MELD score (P=0.02), and more likely to be male (P< 0.01). More patients with CUD were declined during LTE compared to no CUD (18% vs 10%, P = .02). When controlling for age, sex, MELD, and CLD etiology, CUD was associated with 2.2 x risk of being declined during LTE (P< 0.014). In patients with ALD, patients with and without CUD were declined at similar rates (14% vs 8%, P=0.18). However, in patients without ALD, CUD was associated with a 2.2 x risk of being declined during LTE (P = 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest CUD negatively impacts access to liver transplant. However, this impact varies by disease etiology. For example, we found CUD had a more negative impact on patients without alcohol use disorder compared to patients with solely cocaine use as these patients were more likely to be declined from liver transplant listing. The evaluation of liver transplant candidates with a history of CUD requires additional investigation to identify and improve inequalities related to care.

Role of mitochondria in alcoholic liver disease.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Alcohol consumption negatively impacts mitochondrial biogenesis and function, potentially identifying potential therapeutic targets for treating alcoholic liver disease in humans.

Abstract:Alcohol abuse is the leading cause of liver related morbidity and mortality. Chronic or binge alcohol drinking causes hepatic steatosis which can develop to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is poorly characterized, however several recent studies point to a major role of mitochondria in this process. Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism and in reactive species formation. Alcohol treatment causes mitochondrial DNA damage, lipid accumulation and oxidative stress. Studies in both animal models and in humans showed that alcohol administration causes changes in the mitochondrial morphology and function suggesting a role of these changes in the pathogenesis of ALD. We review recent findings on mechanisms by which alcohol negatively impacts mitochondrial biogenesis and function and we will discuss the specific intracellular pathways affected by alcohol consumption. Interestingly, recent findings indicate that a large number of mitochondrial proteins are acetylated and that mitochondrial proteins acetylation and sirtuins are modulated by alcohol. Understanding the mechanisms behind alcohol mediated impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and function may help identify potential therapeutic targets for treating ALD in humans.

Substance abuse treatment and its association with relapse to alcohol use after liver transplantation

Number of 

Key takeaways:Continuing substance abuse treatment after liver transplantation significantly reduces the risk of alcohol relapse.

Abstract:Many liver transplantation (LT) programs require substance abuse (SA) treatment for candidates with a history of alcohol abuse. However, there are no data indicating that SA treatment prevents post‐LT alcohol relapse. We examined 118 adults who underwent LT from May 2002 to February 2011 to explore the relationship between SA treatment and post‐LT relapse to any alcohol use. Sixty‐one patients (52%) with a history of alcohol abuse or dependence received SA treatment before LT. Relapse to any alcohol use was identified in 40 LT recipients (34%). Patients who received SA treatment before LT did not differ significantly in the rate of post‐LT alcohol relapse from patients who did not receive treatment before transplantation (30% versus 39%, P = 0.20). However, patients who received SA treatment both before and after transplantation had significantly lower rates of alcohol relapse (16%) than patients who received no SA treatment (41%) or SA treatment only before LT (45%, P = 0.03). Our findings suggest that LT programs should consider placing more emphasis on the continuation of some type of SA treatment after transplantation. Future research should prospectively examine the optimal timing for SA treatment that will attenuate the risk of alcohol relapse after transplantation.

Alcohol and Drug Use and the Developing Brain

Number of 

Key takeaways:Heavy alcohol and drug use during adolescence is associated with poorer cognitive functioning and altered brain activity, potentially affecting brain development.

Abstract:Adolescence is an important neurodevelopmental period marked by rapidly escalating rates of alcohol and drug use. Over the past decade, research has attempted to disentangle pre- and post-substance use effects on brain development by using sophisticated longitudinal designs. This review focuses on recent, prospective studies and addresses the following important questions: (1) what neuropsychological and neural features predate adolescent substance use, making youth more vulnerable to engage in heavy alcohol or drug use, and (2) how does heavy alcohol and drug use affect normal neural development and cognitive functioning? Findings suggest that pre-existing neural features that relate to increased substance use during adolescence include poorer neuropsychological functioning on tests of inhibition and working memory, smaller gray and white matter volume, changes in white matter integrity, and altered brain activation during inhibition, working memory, reward, and resting state. After substance use is initiated, alcohol and marijuana use are associated with poorer cognitive functioning on tests of verbal memory, visuospatial functioning, psychomotor speed, working memory, attention, cognitive control, and overall IQ. Heavy alcohol use during adolescence is related to accelerated decreases in gray matter and attenuated increases in white matter volume, as well as increased brain activation during tasks of inhibition and working memory, relative to controls. Larger longitudinal studies with more diverse samples are needed to better understand the interactive effects of alcohol, marijuana, and other substances, as well as the role of sex, co-occurring psychopathology, genetics, sleep, and age of initiation on substance use.

Key takeaways:Substance use and abuse are linked to brain changes, but understanding the causes and factors initiating addiction can improve prevention strategies and enhance the lives of affected individuals and their families.

Abstract:That substance abuse is associated with differences in brain structure and function, and related neurocognitive impairment is undisputed. Causally informative study designs, such as the prospective, longitudinal study leveraged by Kim-Spoon et al. (2020), as well as twin and family studies, are necessary for answering vexing but critical questions about substance use and the developing brain. Investigations that seek to differentiate cause from consequence and identify the factors that initiate the cycle of addiction have the potential to transform our understanding of the development of substance use and abuse, prompt revisions to current models of addiction, guide the most strategic preventive-intervention efforts, and ultimately improve the lives of millions of affected individuals and their families.

Substance misuse is often associated with emotional dysregulation. Understanding the neurobiology of emotional responsivity and regulation, as it relates to substance use in adolescence may be beneficial for preventing future use.

METHOD
The present study utilized a community sample, aged 11-21 years old (N = 130, mean age = 17), to investigate the effects of alcohol and marijuana use on emotional reactivity and regulation using an Emotional Go-NoGo task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task consisted of three conditions, where target (Go) stimuli were either happy, scared, or calm faces. Self-report lifetime (and past 90-day) drinking and marijuana use days were provided at all visits.

RESULTS
Substance use was not differentially related to task performance based on condition. Whole-brain linear mixed effects analyses (controlling for age and sex) found more lifetime drinking occasions was associated with greater neural emotional processing (Go trials) in the right middle cingulate cortex during scared vs. calm conditions. Additionally, more marijuana use occasions was associated with less neural emotional processing during scared vs. calm conditions in the right middle cingulate cortex and right middle and inferior frontal gyri. Substance use was not associated with brain activation during inhibition (NoGo trials).

CONCLUSIONS
These findings demonstrate substance-use-related alterations in brain circuitry are important for attention allocation and the integration of emotional processing and motor response when viewing negative emotional stimuli.

Inflammatory Markers in Substance Use and Mood Disorders: A Neuroimaging Perspective

Number of 

Key takeaways:Chronic substance use and stressors contribute to brain inflammation, which may contribute to compulsive drug-use behaviors and worsen mood disorders.

Abstract:Chronic exposure to addictive drugs in substance use disorders and stressors in mood disorders render the brain more vulnerable to inflammation. Inflammation in the brain, or neuroinflammation, is characterized by gliosis, microglial activation, and sustained release of cytokines, chemokines, and pro-inflammatory factors compromising the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. There is increased curiosity in understanding how substance misuse and/or repeated stress exposure affect inflammation and contribute to abnormal neuronal activity, altered neuroplasticity, and impaired cognitive control, which eventually promote compulsive drug-use behaviors and worsen mood disorders. This review will emphasize human imaging studies to explore the link between brain function and peripheral markers of inflammation in substance use disorders and mood disorders.

The international review of neurobiology, effects of peri-adolescent licit and illicit drug use on the developing CNS part 11

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance abuse during adolescence can alter brain structure, function, and neurocognition, increasing the risk of addiction later in life.

Abstract:The International Review of Neurobiology, Effects of PeriAdolescent Licit and illicit Drug Use on the Developing CNS Part 11, (Volume 161) is a scholarly text that provides an excellent review of a diverse range of neuroscience research looking at substance exposure and abuse on the developing brain. The brain is a developmentally dynamic organ and substance abuse can have a very different effect at different times in development. The adolescent brain is at a critical time in neural development. Adolescence is a time of increased myelination, improving integrity of white matter tracts, and neural conductivity (Garnst, 2005). Adolescence is a vulnerable neurodevelopmental age, particularly with regard to risk for drug addiction. Substance abuse during adolescence has been associated with alterations in brain structure, function, and neurocognition (Squeglia et al., 2009). To fully understand the effects of substances on the developing brain it is important to review the empirical literature on substances of abuse and the potential short term and long-term effects on the brain. Some of this research is on human subjects and some is based on animal studies. The International Review of Neurobiology edited by Bell and Rahman (2021) provides excellent reviews of select substances and the effects on the developing brain. Specifically, there are exceptionally informative chapters on the neurobiological effects of cannabis exposure during adolescence, opioid exposure during adolescence, ethanol and nicotine’s action on the brain and risk of future addiction, and the effects of early life stress on subsequent risk of addiction. The cited research combines both animal and human study findings. Chapter 2 does an excellent job in describing nicotine exposure during adolescence and how it activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) Axis and causes dysfunction in the hippocampus. It also provides compelling evidence linking nicotine to alcohol use. Chapter 7 is unique in this text in that it focuses entirely on the blood brain barrier and discusses its role as gatekeeper to limit substance exposure to the brain parenchyma.

Does traumatic brain injury increase risk for substance abuse?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may increase the risk of substance use disorder (SUD), but the directionality of this relationship remains unclear and requires collaborative research.

Abstract:Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have resulted in thousands of military personnel suffering traumatic brain injury (TBI), including closed-head injuries. Of interest is whether these individuals and other TBI survivors are at increased risk for substance use disorder (SUD). While it has been well established that drug or alcohol intoxication itself increases probability of suffering a TBI in accidents or acts of violence, little is known about whether the brain insult itself increases the likelihood that a previously non-drug-abusing individual would develop SUD. Might TBI survivors be unusually vulnerable to addiction to opiate analgesics compared to other pain patients? Similarly, it is not known if TBI increases the likelihood of relapse among persons with SUD in remission. We highlight challenges in answering these questions, and review neurochemical and behavioral evidence that supports a causal relationship between TBI and SUD. In this review, we conclude that little is known regarding the directionality of TBI increasing drug abuse, and that collaborative research in this area is critically needed.

Substance and Drug Abuse on Human Health; A Case Study of Youth in the USA

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance and drug abuse negatively impacts human health among youth in the USA, with consequences ranging from physiological to psychological.

Abstract:A drug is a chemical substance that alters the functioning of the whole body and brain. The study sought to determine the effects of substance and drug abuse on human health among the youth in the USA. The study adopted the descriptive research design. The study used a purposive sampling technique to get a sample size of 200. The collection of the data was done using questionnaires. The analysis of the study was done using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study used tables to present the data. The study found that substance and drug abuse is negatively and significantly related to human health (β=-0.548, p=0.005). Thus, when the rate of substance and drug abuse increases by one unit, the human health among the youth in the USA will reduce by 0.548 units while other factors that influence human health are held unchanged. Substance addiction has numerous negative physiological and psychological health consequences. Drug addiction affects your brain and behavior to the point where you can't control your use of legal or illegal drugs. The study concluded that youth substance and drug abuse is a problem affecting both developing and developed countries. The study recommended that prevention of drug problems can employ knowledge about family dynamics to address personal and social concerns of family members that otherwise would lead to drug abuse, both concerning dysfunctional and intact families. The youth need to be enlightened on the consequences of substance and drug abuse on their health. Measures should be put in place to help the affected youth reform from the use of drugs. Centers for counseling and rehabilitation should be set up to care for the youths who have fallen into this trap of substance abuse. Keywords: Substance and drug abuse, human health, youth, USA

Interoception Within the Context of Impulsivity and Addiction

Number of 

Key takeaways:Interoception may contribute to impulsive behavior and addiction, with substance abuse negatively impacting the brain's ability to process interoceptive information and reward system.

Abstract:Abstract Purpose of Review The goal of this review is to examine the relationship between impulsivity and interoception in addiction, to summarize the current understanding of the topic, identify any gaps in knowledge, and provide directions for future research. Research Findings Interoception may be a contributing factor to impulsive behaviour and, thus, addiction. Substance abuse can negatively impact the brain’s ability to process interoceptive information and impact the reward system, leading to decreased sensitivity to natural rewards and increased sensitivity to drugs. There is potential for new therapies, such as mindfulness, interoceptive training, brain stimulation, or vagal nerve stimulation to target both impulsivity and interoception in the treatment of addiction. Summary Despite a growing interest in interoception in addiction research, further research is needed to better understand the role of interoception in addiction and to develop new methods for studying how individuals with addiction process and perceive internal bodily sensations.

Neurobiology of Addiction.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Drug abuse leads to brain changes, causing compulsiveness, impulsivity, and negative emotions, which can be understood and targeted for treatment.

Abstract:Drugs of abuse can cause changes in the brain leading to addiction. Current scientific focus has been on how these drugs interact with the brain and the changes they cause, how those changes affect human behavior and how they may last beyond termination of drug use. Compulsiveness in seeking the drug, impulsiveness in consuming the drug, and negative affect when the drug is withheld are characteristic of addiction. Each of these characteristics has a root in neurobiology and understanding their mechanisms helps us to understand addiction and see potential targets for treatment.

Negative Implications of Drug and Substance use on Mental Health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Drug abuse negatively impacts mental health, leading to neurobiological alterations and structural changes in the brain, societal burdens, and stigma.

Abstract:Mental health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being, which encompasses aspects such as thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and the ability to cope with life's challenges. Several factors including drug abuse have been recognized to cause mental health disorders; hence, the urgent need to globally address these factors. Drug abuse emerges as a complex public health issue, involving the misuse of legal and illegal drugs, with consequences extending beyond individual health. The relationship between mental health and drug abuse intensifies challenges, as drug misuse contributes to the development or worsening of mental health disorders. This review examined biological, psychological, and social determinants, and advocate for a standardized approach to address the complex issue of drug abuse. Various electronic databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, and others, were used to access resources, in which thirty-three (33) literatures were reviewed. Results of the reviewed literatures revealed that the impact of drug abuse on mental health involves neurobiological alterations affecting neurotransmitter levels and structural changes in the brain. This does not only affect individuals, but also results in societal burdens, such as increased healthcare costs and criminal justice involvement, compounded by the stigma surrounding mental health and substance abuse. The classification of drugs into legal and illegal categories highlights the diversity of substances and emphasizes the need to understand their effects on mental well-being. Categories include legal drugs, prescription medications, socially accepted substances, and illegal drugs with varying dependency potentials. Addressing mental health disorders induced by drug abuse requires a comprehensive approach, involving strategies like Integrated Dual Diagnosis Treatment (IDDT), Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT), Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Motivational Interviewing (MI), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Peer Support, 12-Step Programs, and Recovery-Oriented Systems of Care (ROSC). These methods guarantee a care continuum that centers on the individual and emphasizes recovery, acknowledging the relationship between mental health and drug abuse disorders. Nevertheless, the review highlights a research gap in that, in-depth research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the aforementioned interventions. Additionally, exploring innovative strategies to address challenges such as stigma, limited treatment accessibility, and the cyclical nature of addiction would enhance intervention effectiveness.

Substance Abuse Co-Occurrence with Mental Health Issues

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance abuse and mental health disorders often co-occur in adolescents and young adults, and incorporating both treatments can provide a more comprehensive intervention strategy.

Abstract:Substance abuse, including the use of alcohol and other drugs, is one of the most prevalent disorders among adolescents and young adults, co-occurring with many other psychiatric and mental health disorders. Some use of alcohol and drugs can be expected during adolescence; however, it is necessary to use screening tools to differentiate between misuse of drugs and alcohol and substance abuse. Some brief and comprehensive screening instruments are mentioned in this chapter for future reference. General indicators of substance abuse disorders such as physical and emotional symptoms, family issues, and social problems are explored, and the chapter discusses some of the most commonly abused drugs. Emphasis is put on incorporating treatments of substance abuse with treatments of mental illness for a more comprehensive intervention strategy for people with co-occurring disorders.

Study to See the Impact of Alcohol and Drug Abuse on Health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Long-term substance use and chemical dependence increase the risk of multiple systemic diseases, emphasizing the need for effective prevention, policy change, and rehabilitation programs.

Abstract:Substance abuse, including addiction to alcohol and drugs, is a major threat to the person, social stability, and economic productivity. We will review the use of alcohol and drugs and their effects on various aspects of physical and mental health, with a specific focus on the long-range effects of the abuse of substances on well-being. It synthesizes and standardizes existing literature, theoretical frameworks, and empirical findings to assess the direct and indirect effects of atmospheric exposure — such as organ damage, neurological conditions and psychological health — on the Down syndrome population. The patterns of substance abuse and their effects may be analysed by using a stepwise methodology that uses both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Long-term substance use and chemical dependence correspond with an increased risk of multiple systemic diseases similar to these findings, advocating the need for effective prevention, policy change, and rehabilitation programs. The paper also describes limitations and suggests for future studies to continue exploring ways to implement strategies to mitigate substance dependency.

Mental health and substance use among sexual minority women who report childhood sexual abuse: A systematic literature review.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sexual minority women report higher rates of childhood sexual abuse than heterosexual women, which may mediate the relationship between minority sexual identity and negative mental health and substance use outcomes.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
A growing body of literature provides evidence that sexual minority women (SMW; e.g., lesbian, bisexual) are at greater risk of negative mental health and substance use outcomes than are heterosexual women. While minority stress may partially explain these disparities, it does not fully account for them. Therefore, it is necessary to identify how other risk factors (i.e., childhood sexual abuse ) contribute to SMW's increased risk of negative mental health and substance use outcomes.

METHOD
We conducted a systematic literature review to identify and synthesize the state of knowledge about CSA and mental health and substance use outcomes among SMW. Two independent reviewers screened 347 articles identified in searches of five databases (Web of Science, PsycInfo, CINAHL, PubMed, and Embase). Eligible articles were peer-reviewed, reported quantitative or mixed methods results focused on mental health or substance use outcomes among adult SMW with a history of CSA.

RESULTS
Twenty-four papers were included in the review. Findings clearly show that SMW report higher rates of CSA than heterosexual women. Findings also suggest that CSA may mediate the relationship between minority sexual identity and some negative outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS
Future studies should include minority stress factors, a broader range of mental health outcomes (apart from substance use and suicide), and more nuanced measures of CSA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

Stigma Toward Substance Dependence: Causes, Consequences, and Potential Interventions

Number of 

Key takeaways:Stigma towards substance dependence negatively impacts individuals' access to employment, housing, and health, with potential interventions to reduce stigma and improve outcomes.

Abstract:Substance dependence is a prevalent and urgent public health problem. In 2021, 60 million Americans reported abusing alcohol within the month prior to being surveyed, and nearly 20 million Americans reported using illegal drugs (e.g., heroin) or prescription drugs (e.g., opioids) for nonmedical reasons in the year before. Drug-involved overdose rates have been steadily increasing over the past 20 years. This increase has been primarily driven by opioid and stimulant use. Despite its prevalence, drug dependence is one of the most stigmatized health conditions. Stigma has myriad negative consequences for its targets, including limiting their access to employment and housing, disrupting interpersonal relationships, harming physical and mental health, and reducing help-seeking. However, because research on stigma toward people with substance use disorders (SUDs) is relatively sparse compared with research on stigma toward other mental illnesses, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of the causes and consequences of SUD stigma. Moreover, it remains unclear how, if at all, these factors differ from other types of mental illness stigma. The goal of this review is to take stock of the literature on SUD stigma, providing a clear set of foundational principles and a blueprint for future research and translational activity.

How Resilience Promotes Mental Health of Patients With DSM-5 Substance Use Disorder? The Mediation Roles of Positive Affect, Self-Esteem, and Perceived Social Support

Number of 

Key takeaways:Resilience promotes mental health in substance use disorder patients by enhancing positive affect, self-esteem, and perceived social support.

Abstract:Objectives: The existing studies found that resilience is a salient trait that can significantly affect people's psychological well-being with substance use disorders (SUDs). However, few studies examined how the mechanisms are connected between resilience and mental health among patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—fifth edition SUD. This study investigated the mediation effects of positive affect, perceived social support, and self-esteem on the effect of resilience on perceived stress and life satisfaction in SUD patients. Design: A total of 415 patients diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—fifth edition SUD from the south of China joined the research. Outcome Measures: The study applied Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Satisfaction with Life Scale to measure patients' resilience, positive affect, self-esteem, perceived social support, perceived stress, and life satisfaction. Results: Structural equation model analysis revealed that positive affect and self-esteem partially mediate the relationship between resilience and perceived stress. In contrast, positive affect and perceived social support partially mediate the relationship between resilience and life satisfaction. Conclusion: The findings provide insights for evidence-based substance abuse intervention that positive affect, self-esteem, and perceived social support can conditional the effects of resilience on promoting the mental health of SUD patients.

Do the parents of the youth abusing substances need to be supported? A literature review study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Parents of youth abusing substances need support programs to help them cope with the stress and maintain mental health.

Abstract:Background Substance abuse negatively affects the youth who use substances, their families and especially their parents. The use of substances impairs the health of the youth and is linked to an increase in noncommunicable diseases. Parents become stressed and they need help. Parents fail to carry out daily plans and routines because they are not sure what the substance abuser can do or what can happen to the substance abuser. When the parents’ well-being is taken care of, they will be able to take care of their youth when they need help. Unfortunately, little is known about the psychosocial needs of the parents, especially when their child abuses substances. Objectives This article aims to review the literature to explore the need for support for parents of youth abusing substances. Method The study adopted the narrative literature review (NLR) methodology. Literature was retrieved from the following databases and search engines: electronic databases, search engines and hand searches. Results Substance abuse has been found to affect the youth abusing substances and their families negatively. The parents, being the most affected, need support. The involvement of health professionals can assist the parents in feeling supported. Conclusion Parents need support programmes that will give support and strength to their existing abilities. Contribution Focusing on the support needs of the parents of youth abusing substances will help to ensure parents are supported and mentally healthy.

Substance abuse: A public health concern

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance abuse is a complex public health issue, with risk factors and treatment modalities influencing teenage drug usage, requiring intensive efforts across various domains to prevent misuse.

Abstract:The context and purpose of the study. Substance abuse is a serious public health concern that affects the millions of people worldwide. It refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including drugs and alcohol, that can lead to various health problems, such as addiction, mental health disorders, and physical illness. Alcohol, nicotine, and other illicit drugs are frequently used in excess in substance use disorders, which can impair social, academic, and professional functioning. Cannabis, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, inhalants, opioids, hallucinogens, and stimulants are the most abused drugs. Throughout human history, substance abuse has been a complex public health issue. The two main approaches frequently used to address the issue of substance abuse are risk factors and treatment modalities. They relate to the various fields of genetic inheritance, physiology, cognitive science, parents, social development, and cultural structures. One of the main issues with public health in today's culture is drug misuse. Recently, there has been an upsurge in the prevalence of drug usage, especially opioid abuse, worldwide and in Kashmir. This review paper points to a complicated interplay between various variables that affect teenage drug usage. It also describes the different risk factors leading to substance abuse and the various behavioral therapies for substance use disorders that may enhance patient results. As a result, intensive effort across all the levels of domains will be needed to create programmes that prevent teenage substance misuse.

Mental Health Help Seeking Among Traumatized Individuals: A Systematic Review of Studies Assessing the Role of Substance Use and Abuse.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance abuse generally increases the likelihood of mental health utilization among traumatized individuals, except in younger populations with recent trauma.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
Prior research has suggested that competing neurobehavioral decision-making processes might affect health outcomes among traumatized populations. Regulatory imbalances to impulsive and executive decision systems are affected by high levels of stress, including stress resulting from traumatic events. Such regulatory imbalances have been associated with addictive behaviors. However, it is not well known whether addictive behavior increases or decreases the likelihood of utilization of behavioral health services among traumatized populations. The aim of this study is to systematically review mental health utilization studies targeting traumatized populations to determine the direction of association between substance use and behavioral health utilization.

METHOD
Databases of literature were searched in a systematic manner, and 37 relevant studies were recovered and analyzed.

FINDINGS
Of the 37 relevant studies that included addictive behaviors as a predictor of utilization, 16 showed a positive significant relationship and 6 showed a negative significant relationship. Studies showing a negative significant relationship used younger samples with more recent trauma exposure.

CONCLUSION
Studies have shown that for the most part, substance abuse increases the likelihood of utilization, except among younger populations with more recent trauma. Longitudinal studies that access how utilization evolves over time among traumatized populations and interacts with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse severity are necessary to better understand how decision-making processes of traumatized individuals may increase the likelihood of chronic PTSD.

The Factors Affecting Substance Use and the Most Effective Mental Health Interventions in Adolescents and Young Adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Adolescents with weak sense of self, family attachment, parental monitoring, and role models are more likely to abuse substances, while interventions that strengthen self-image and engage students in positive behaviors can help.

Abstract:Adolescents and young adults are particularly susceptible to substance abuse. They have yet to solidify their sense of self to the degree necessary to effectively resist temptations from negative peer pressure. It is vital for mental health counselors to understand the factors affecting substance abuse in adolescents/young adults and to comprehend the effectiveness of common intervention strategies fully. This paper produces a narrative literature review of 27 international journal publications from 2004 through June 2024 related to causal factors and interventions effective for treating substance abuse in adolescents and young adults. The results indicate that adolescents who idolize antisocial peers and lack a strong sense of self, family attachment, parental monitoring, and role models are more likely to suffer from substance abuse. Successful interventions include those that help strengthen the adolescent’s sense of self, a mental-health-friendly school environment staffed with professional mental health counselors, and interactive programs that engage students in positive behaviors. Positive family and peer role models can also assist in helping adolescents/young adults build a strong self-image and resist substance use. Positive peer influence is another critical factor, but more work must be undertaken to fully assess its effectiveness as an intervention.

The Impact of Substance Abuse on Family Members Mental Health Status.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance abuse significantly impacts family members' mental health, with 29.4% having mental disorders compared to 16% without substance abusers.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
The effects of substance abuse frequently extend beyond the nuclear family. Extended family members may experience feelings of abandonment, anxiety, fear, anger, concern, embarrassment, or guilt; they may wish to ignore or cut ties with the person abusing substance. The aim of this study was to compare the mental health status on families with and without substance abusers.

METHOD
This cross sectional study was conducted among 114 family's members with substance abusers (case group) and 114 without substance abusers (control group) in Hamadan city in Iran, from October to December 2016. Data collection tools included demographic and SCL-90-R questionnaires. Data were analyzed by t- test using SPSS software version 16. The significance level was considered less than 0.05.

RESULTS
The Mean age of participants in the case and control groups was 33±4.7 and 35±5.2 years. There was a significant difference in the mean of subscales included somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety and phobia in the families with and without substance abusers (p< 0.001). In other words, the mental health status of family members with a substance abuser were lower than in the control group. Overall 29.4% of family's members with substance abusers and 16% of without substance abusers were suspected to have mental disorders.

CONCLUSION
Substance abuse is a disorder that can impact families in countless ways. Therefore, it is recommended that more attention be given to this group in planning of mental health and should be screened by health professional in term of psychological needs and planning to promotion their mental health.

Moderation Effects of Substance Use on Physical and Mental Well-Being in Adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Substance abuse can moderate the relationship between physical activity and mental health in adults, with nondrinkers and smokers experiencing fewer mental health problems when engaging in more physical activity.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Each year about one in five adults experiences mental illness. Although the independent physical and mental health consequences of alcohol misuse and cigarette smoking are well documented, little is known on how substance use moderates the relationship between physical and mental well-being. AIM: The purpose of this study was to examine whether substance use moderates the relationship between physical activity and mental health in adults. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data provided by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). RESULTS: Participants (N = 450,016) were adults who completed the BRFSS in 2017. Those who did not drink alcohol had fewer mental health problems when they indicated greater amounts of time spent doing physical activities each week. Last, smokers’ number of mental health problems decreased as they engaged in more physical activity, whereas nonsmokers’ number of mental health problems increased as they engaged in more physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between physical activity and mental health outcomes is well established and cannot be overemphasized. Nonetheless, substance abuse can moderate this relationship and should be routinely screened for by health care providers regardless of treatment setting.
