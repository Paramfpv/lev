Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation – the main risk factor for skin and eye diseases

Excessive exposure to UV radiation is considered one of the most significant threats to the health of the skin and eyes. It causes DNA damage, accelerates aging processes, weakens the immune system of the skin, and increases the risk of skin cancers and serious eye diseases such as cataracts or pterygium. Prolonged exposure without proper protection carries serious health consequences, which can be effectively minimized by using protective measures.

Level of evidence:Strong

UV radiation penetrates the skin and eye tissues, where it causes direct DNA damage leading to mutations. Additionally, UV induces oxidative stress, generating free radicals that damage cells and tissue structures. Furthermore, UV induces local immunosuppression, which reduces the body's ability to fight damaged cells and pathogens. These mechanisms lead to accelerated skin aging, cancer development, and serious vision damage. Protection against UV with clothing, UV-filtered sunglasses, and avoiding peak sun hours is crucial to preventing these effects.

The harmfulness of excessive UV exposure is unequivocally confirmed by numerous epidemiological studies, systematic reviews, and clinical data. UV radiation causes serious damage to the skin and eyes, leading to many chronic diseases and cancers.

Excessive exposure to UV radiation is a serious global health problem, affecting millions of people and generating high treatment costs and burden on healthcare systems.

UV Radiation and the Skin

Number of 

Key takeaways:UV radiation is a complex carcinogen with complex mixed effects on human health, causing skin cancer and other disorders, but also promoting vitamin D synthesis and endorphin production.

Abstract:UV radiation (UV) is classified as a “complete carcinogen” because it is both a mutagen and a non-specific damaging agent and has properties of both a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter. In environmental abundance, UV is the most important modifiable risk factor for skin cancer and many other environmentally-influenced skin disorders. However, UV also benefits human health by mediating natural synthesis of vitamin D and endorphins in the skin, therefore UV has complex and mixed effects on human health. Nonetheless, excessive exposure to UV carries profound health risks, including atrophy, pigmentary changes, wrinkling and malignancy. UV is epidemiologically and molecularly linked to the three most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, which together affect more than a million Americans annually. Genetic factors also influence risk of UV-mediated skin disease. Polymorphisms of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, in particular, correlate with fairness of skin, UV sensitivity, and enhanced cancer risk. We are interested in developing UV-protective approaches based on a detailed understanding of molecular events that occur after UV exposure, focusing particularly on epidermal melanization and the role of the MC1R in genome maintenance.

Key takeaways:UV radiation causes skin cancer, edema, and sunburns, and may induce immune modulations, leading to local and systemic immunosuppression.

Abstract:Sunlight comprises radiation of different wavelengths, of which UVA and UVB are most important with respect to human skin diseases. Next to erythema, edema, and sunburns, UV radiation causes skin cancer. UV radiation of any wavelength is now considered as a class I carcinogen to humans. The mutagenic effects of UV radiation depend on DNA damage following direct absorption by nuclear DNA, resulting in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts that, if not repaired by nucleotide excision repair pathway, result in characteristic UV signature mutations (C→T or CC→TT transition). In addition, increased formation of reactive oxygen species by UV exposure may cause formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine leading to T→G transversion. In addition, UV radiation has been shown to induce a number of immune modulations that largely result in local and potentially also in systemic immunosuppression, which may not only impair control of dysplastic and neoplastic skin lesions but also affect immuno-pathological and infectious skin diseases. Recent find-ings have shown that ambient doses of high-energy visible light, beyond the UV range, may also cause damage to human skin.

Key takeaways:Excessive sun exposure can cause irreversible damage to the skin, making it crucial to use photoprotectors correctly and implement educational measures to avoid damage.

Abstract:Introduction: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main environmental factor that affects skin wear, where photoaging is the result of the effects of solar radiation together with chronological aging of the skin and under these conditions, skin functions that are already compromised can be further affected. The use of photoprotectors and access to information on sun exposure are extremely important to avoid damage to the skin. Objectives: To evaluate the importance of skin care in preventing extrinsic aging, thus contributing to dermatological health and long-term well-being. Methodology: This research project is an integrative review with the objective of studying the effects of UVR on the skin using articles available in databases from 2012 to 2024, carrying out the research in the time interval between February and April 2025. Results: In the articles analyzed, it was possible to understand the effects of UVR on the skin and the effectiveness of preventive care. The results demonstrated a significant correlation between unprotected sun exposure and increased signs of skin photoaging, such as wrinkles, spots and loss of elasticity. Conclusion: It can be concluded that excessive sun exposure can cause irreversible damage to the skin and that it is of great importance to use photoprotectors correctly and implement educational measures in order to avoid such damage.

Ozone Layer Depletion and Emerging Public Health Concerns - An Update on Epidemiological Perspective of the Ambivalent Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure

Key takeaways:Optimal sun exposure is essential for maintaining healthy vitamin D levels and preventing skin cancer, but balancing sun protection measures with optimal sun exposure is crucial for public health.

Abstract:Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is the primary etiological agent responsible for developing cutaneous malignancies. Avoiding excessive radiation exposure, especially by high-risk groups, is recommended to prevent UV-induced photo-pathologies. However, optimal sun exposure is essential for the healthy synthesis of about 90% of vitamin D levels in the body. Insufficient exposure to UV-B is linked to vitamin D deficiency in humans. Therefore, optimal sun exposure is necessary for maintaining a normal state of homeostasis in the skin. Humans worldwide face a major existential threat because of climate change which has already shown its effects in several ways. Over the last 4 to 5 decades, increased incidences in skin cancer cases have led international health organizations to develop strong sun protection measures. However, at the same time, a growing concern about vitamin D deficiency is creating a kind of exposure dilemma. Current knowledge of UV exposure to skin outweighs the adverse effects than the beneficial roles it offers to the body, necessitating a correct public health recommendation on optimal sun exposure. Following an appropriate recommendation on optimal sun exposure will lead to positive outcomes in protecting humans against the adverse effects of strict recommendations on sun protection measures. In this short review, we spotlight the ambivalent health effects of UV exposure and how ozone layer depletion has influenced these effects of UVR. Further, our aim remains to explore how to lead towards a balanced recommendation on sun protection measures to prevent the spurt of diseases due to inadequate exposure to UV-B.

Photoaging: UV radiation-induced inflammation and immunosuppression accelerate the aging process in the skin

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive exposure to UV radiation accelerates skin aging by triggering inflammation and immunosuppression, similar to the aging process caused by chronic low-grade inflammation in normal aging.

Abstract:Excessive exposure of the skin to UV radiation (UVR) triggers a remodeling of the immune system and leads to the photoaging state which is reminiscent of chronological aging. Over 30 years ago, it was observed that UVR induced an immunosuppressive state which inhibited skin contact hypersensitivity.Original and review articles encompassing inflammation and immunosuppression in the photoaging and chronological aging processes were examined from major databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar.Currently it is known that UVR treatment can trigger a cellular senescence and inflammatory state in the skin. Chronic low-grade inflammation stimulates a counteracting immunosuppression involving an expansion of immunosuppressive cells, e.g., regulatory T cells (Treg), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and regulatory dendritic cells (DCreg). This increased immunosuppressive activity not only suppresses the function of effector immune cells, a state called immunosenescence, but it also induces bystander degeneration of neighboring cells. Interestingly, the chronological aging process also involves an accumulation of pro-inflammatory senescent cells and signs of chronic low-grade inflammation, called inflammaging. There is also clear evidence that inflammaging is associated with an increase in anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities which promote immunosenescence.It seems that photoaging and normal aging evoke similar processes driven by the remodeling of the immune system. However, it is likely that there are different molecular mechanisms inducing inflammation and immunosuppression in the accelerated photoaging and the chronological aging processes.

Key takeaways:Excessive sun exposure increases the risk of skin cancer and other skin disorders, and understanding molecular events can help develop effective UV-protective strategies tailored to individual genetics and risk factors.

Abstract:: UV radiation (UV) is designated as a 'comprehensive carcinogen' due to its dual nature as a mutagen and a non-specific damaging agent, exhibiting properties of both a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter. UV radiation is the foremost modifiable risk factor for skin cancer and various other environmentally-influenced skin disorders. Nevertheless, UV radiation also plays a beneficial role in human health by facilitating the natural synthesis of vitamin D and endorphins in the skin. Consequently, UV radiation exhibits complex and diverse effects on human health. However, excessive exposure to UV radiation poses significant health risks, including skin atrophy, pigmentary alterations, wrinkling, and malignancy. Epidemiological and molecular evidence establish a clear link between UV radiation and the three most prevalent types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma, collectively impacting over a million Americans each year. Furthermore, genetic factors contribute to the susceptibility of UV-mediated skin diseases. Notably, specific variations in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene are associated with skin fairness, UV sensitivity, and heightened cancer risk. In light of these findings, our research aims to develop innovative UV-protective strategies by comprehensively understanding the molecular events that occur following UV exposure, with a specific focus on epidermal melanization and the pivotal role played by the MC1R in maintaining the integrity of the genome. By leveraging this knowledge, we endeavor to devise pharmaceutical interventions that can effectively mitigate the detrimental effects of UV radiation on the skin, reduce the risk of skin cancer, and enhance skin health. Such advancements will not only contribute to safeguarding individuals from the harmful consequences of excessive UV exposure but also pave the way for novel approaches in the field of dermatology and personalized medicine, tailored to the individual's genetic makeup and specific risk factors .

Key takeaways:Early counseling and screening are essential for improving skin health and preventing skin problems caused by excessive sun exposure in St. Anna's elderly population.

Abstract:Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, especially UVB and UVA, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of skin damage. Excessive sun exposure causes various skin problems, such as burning, dehydration, and premature aging, and increases the risk of skin cancer. Precautions such as using sunscreen, protective clothing, and avoiding peak UV exposure times are essential. Using the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, we carry out facial skin health checks, including education about sun protection, identification of skin problems, and follow-up interventions. 33 participants (11 men and 22 women) participated in this activity. It was found that the average wrinkle, roughness, moist, and UV damage were 17%, 20%, 46%, and 22.18% respectively. Early counseling and screening is essential to increase awareness, change behavior, and prevent skin problems, ultimately improving skin health and improving quality of life.

Abstract:Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and its effects on the skin continue to be are still intensively studied by scientists. UV protection is one of the most discussed topics in cosmetology and dermatology clinics. The study aimed to review the literature on ultraviolet radiation and its positive and negative influence on skin condition. The article provided information regarding the various types of radiation and techniques for photoprotection. In recent years, there has been no change in the impact of ultraviolet radiation and the consequences of excessive exposure to the skin. Nevertheless, a shift in public awareness is observed. Proper use of solar radiation and careful selection of photoprotection methods can slow down the effects of photoaging and decrease the risk of developing skin cancers, all while enabling the body to receive advantageous outcomes.

Natural Antioxidants: Multiple Mechanisms to Protect Skin From Solar Radiation

Number of 

Key takeaways:Natural antioxidants, such as botanical products, can protect skin from solar UVR and slow down aging effects, making them suitable for topical application.

Abstract:Human skin exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in a dramatic increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The sudden increase in ROS shifts the natural balance toward a pro-oxidative state, resulting in oxidative stress. The detrimental effects of oxidative stress occur through multiple mechanisms that involve alterations to proteins and lipids, induction of inflammation, immunosuppression, DNA damage, and activation of signaling pathways that affect gene transcription, cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. All of these alterations promote carcinogenesis and therefore, regulation of ROS levels is critical to the maintenance of normal skin homeostasis. Several botanical products have been found to exhibit potent antioxidant capacity and the ability to counteract UV-induced insults to the skin. These natural products exert their beneficial effects through multiple pathways, including some known to be negatively affected by solar UVR. Aging of the skin is also accelerated by UVR exposure, in particular UVA rays that penetrate deep into the epidermis and the dermis where it causes the degradation of collagen and elastin fibers via oxidative stress and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Because natural compounds are capable of attenuating some of the UV-induced aging effects in the skin, increased attention has been generated in the area of cosmetic sciences. The focus of this review is to cover the most prominent phytoproducts with potential to mitigate the deleterious effects of solar UVR and suitability for use in topical application.

Illuminating the Connection: Cutaneous Vitamin D3 Synthesis and Its Role in Skin Cancer Prevention

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sunlight exposure plays a crucial role in vitamin D3 production and skin cancer prevention, but excessive UVB exposure can increase the risk of skin cancer through DNA damage and oxidative stress.

Abstract:Sunlight exposure plays an important role in human health, impacting processes such as mood, blood pressure regulation, and vitamin D3 production. Solar ultraviolet B radiation initiates vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin, which is subsequently metabolized into its biologically active form. UVB exposure plays a key role in enabling vitamin D3 synthesis, but it can also contribute to skin carcinogenesis, creating a complex interplay between its beneficial and harmful effects. Vitamin D deficiency, affecting over half the global population, is linked to a range of chronic diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular conditions, and autoimmune disorders. Simultaneously, excessive solar UVB exposure increases the risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers through mechanisms involving DNA damage and oxidative stress. This review examines the dual role of UVB radiation in health and disease, focusing on the mechanisms of cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis, the epidemiology of skin cancer, and the protective roles of vitamin D3’s photoproducts and its active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Understanding these interconnections is critical for developing strategies that balance adequate sun-induced vitamin D3 production with skin cancer prevention.

Key takeaways:UVB radiation is a poor activator of the Nrf2-driven pathway in fibroblasts, while UVA radiation stimulates Nrf2 activation in dermal fibroblasts, with unclear effects on keratinocytes and melanocytes.

Abstract:Abstract Purpose Excessive exposure of skin to solar radiation is associated with greatly increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) resulting in oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, immunosuppression, the production of matrix metalloproteinase, DNA damage and mutations. These events lead to increased incidence of various skin disorders including photoaing and both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers. The ultraviolet (UV) part of sunlight, in particular, is responsible for structural and cellular changes across the different layers of the skin. Among other effects, UV photons stimulate oxidative damage to biomolecules via the generation of unstable and highly reactive compounds. In response to oxidative damage, cytoprotective pathways are triggered. One of these is the pathway driven by the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). This transcription factor translocates to the nucleus and drives the expression of numerous genes, among them various detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. Several studies concerning the effects of UV radiation on Nrf2 activation have been published, but different UV wavelengths, skin cells or tissues and incubation periods were used in the experiments that complicate the evaluation of UV radiation effects. Conclusions This review summarizes the effects of UVB (280–315 nm) and UVA (315–400 nm) radiation on the Nrf2 signaling pathway in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes. The effects of natural compounds (pure compounds or mixtures) on Nrf2 activation and level as well as on Nrf2-driven genes in UV irradiated human skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes are briefly mentioned as well. Highlights UVB radiation is a rather poor activator of the Nrf2-driven pathway in fibroblasts UVA radiation stimulates Nrf2 activation in dermal fibroblasts Effects of UVA on the Nrf2 pathway in keratinocytes and melanocytes remain unclear Long-term Nrf2 activation in keratinocytes disturbs their normal differentiation Pharmacological activation of Nrf2 in the skin needs to be performed carefully

The consequences for human health of stratospheric ozone depletion in association with other environmental factors

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ozone depletion and changing sun exposure habits contribute to increased UV-B radiation exposure, leading to skin cancer, immune suppression, and eye damage.

Abstract:Due to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which has limited, and is now probably reversing, the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, only modest increases in solar UV-B radiation at the surface of the Earth have occurred. For many fair-skinned populations, changing behaviour with regard to exposure to the sun over the past half century - more time in the sun, less clothing cover (more skin exposed), and preference for a tan - has probably contributed more to greater levels of exposure to UV-B radiation than ozone depletion. Exposure to UV-B radiation has both adverse and beneficial effects on human health. This report focuses on an assessment of the evidence regarding these outcomes that has been published since our previous report in 2010. The skin and eyes are the organs exposed to solar UV radiation. Excessive solar irradiation causes skin cancer, including cutaneous malignant melanoma and the non-melanoma skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and contributes to the development of other rare skin cancers such as Merkel cell carcinoma. Although the incidence of melanoma continues to increase in many countries, in some locations, primarily those with strong sun protection programmes, incidence has stabilised or decreased over the past 5 years, particularly in younger age-groups. However, the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers is still increasing in most locations. Exposure of the skin to the sun also induces systemic immune suppression that may have adverse effects on health, such as through the reactivation of latent viral infections, but also beneficial effects through suppression of autoimmune reactivity. Solar UV-B radiation damages the eyes, causing cataracts and pterygium. UV-B irradiation of the skin is the main source of vitamin D in many geographic locations. Vitamin D plays a critical role in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the body; severe deficiency causes the bone diseases, rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Although many studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency in a wide range of diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, more recent evidence is less compelling, with meta-analyses of supplementation trials failing to show a beneficial effect on the health outcomes that have been tested. It continues to be difficult to provide public health messages to guide safe exposure to the sun that are accurate, simple, and can be used by people with different skin types, in different locations, and for different times of the year or day. There is increasing interest in relating sun protection messages to the UV Index. Current sun protection strategies are outlined and assessed. Climatic factors affect the amount of UV radiation received by the skin and eyes, separately from the effect of ozone depletion. For example, cloud cover can decrease or increase the intensity of UV radiation at Earth’s surface and warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns may alter the amount of time people spend outdoors and their choice of clothing. The combination of changes in climate and UV radiation may affect the number of pathogenic microorganisms in surface waters, and could have an impact on food security through effects on plant and aquatic systems. It remains difficult to quantify these effects and their possible importance for human health.

A Scoping Review on the Effects of Carotenoids and Flavonoids on Skin Damage Due to Ultraviolet Radiation

Key takeaways:Phytonutrients found in plants, such as flavonoids and carotenoids, show potential in preventing UV-induced skin damage and potentially aiding in the prevention and treatment of sunburn, photoaging, and UV-related skin cancers.

Abstract:Skin exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in the sun causes premature ageing and may predispose to skin cancers. UV radiation generates excessive free radical species, resulting in oxidative stress, which is responsible for cellular and DNA damage. There is growing evidence that phytonutrients such as flavonoids and carotenoids may impede oxidative stress and prevent photodamage. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to explore the effects of certain phytonutrients in preventing skin photodamage. We searched the electronic Medline (Ovid) and Pubmed databases for relevant studies published between 2002 and 2022. The main inclusion criteria were articles written in English, and studies reporting the effects of phytonutrient-containing plants of interest on the skin or skin cells exposed to UV radiation. We focused on tea, blueberries, lemon, carrot, tomato, and grapes, which are rich in flavonoids and/or carotenoids. Out of 434 articles retrieved, 40 were identified as potentially relevant. Based on our inclusion criteria, nine articles were included in the review. The review comprises three combined in vitro and animal studies, four human studies, one in vitro research, and one mixed in vitro and human study. All the studies reported positive effects of flavonoids and carotenoid-containing plant extract on UV-induced skin damage. This evidence-based review highlights the potential use of flavonoids and carotenoids found in plants in preventing the deleterious effects of UV radiation on the skin. These compounds may have a role in clinical and aesthetic applications for the prevention and treatment of sunburn and photoaging, and may potentially be used against UV-related skin cancers.

Key takeaways:The Montreal Protocol can prevent skin cancer, eye damage, and autoimmune diseases, while also providing vitamin D and immune system benefits.

Abstract:This assessment by the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) of the Montreal Protocol under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) evaluates the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on human health within the context of the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments. We assess work published since our last comprehensive assessment in 2018. Over the last four years gains have been made in knowledge of the links between sun exposure and health outcomes, mechanisms, and estimates of disease burden, including economic impacts. Of particular note, there is new information about the way in which exposure to UV radiation modulates the immune system, causing both harms and benefits for health. The burden of skin cancer remains high, with many lives lost to melanoma and many more people treated for keratinocyte cancer, but it has been estimated that the Montreal Protocol will prevent 11 million cases of melanoma and 432 million cases of keratinocyte cancer that would otherwise have occurred in the United States in people born between 1890 and 2100. While the incidence of skin cancer continues to rise, rates have stabilised in younger populations in some countries. Mortality has also plateaued, partly due to the use of systemic therapies for advanced disease. However, these therapies are very expensive, contributing to the extremely high economic burden of skin cancer, and emphasising the importance and comparative cost-effectiveness of prevention. Photodermatoses, inflammatory skin conditions induced by exposure to UV radiation, can have a marked detrimental impact on the quality of life of sufferers. More information is emerging about their potential link with commonly used drugs, particularly anti-hypertensives. The eyes are also harmed by over-exposure to UV radiation. The incidence of cataract and pterygium is continuing to rise, and there is now evidence of a link between intraocular melanoma and sun exposure. It has been estimated that the Montreal Protocol will prevent 63 million cases of cataract that would otherwise have occurred in the United States in people born between 1890 and 2100. Despite the clearly established harms, exposure to UV radiation also has benefits for human health. While the best recognised benefit is production of vitamin D, beneficial effects mediated by factors other than vitamin D are emerging. For both sun exposure and vitamin D, there is increasingly convincing evidence of a positive role in diseases related to immune function, including both autoimmune diseases and infection. With its influence on the intensity of UV radiation and global warming, the Montreal Protocol has, and will have, both direct and indirect effects on human health, potentially changing the balance of the risks and benefits of spending time outdoors.

Key takeaways:Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation can contribute to oxidative stress, leading to serious ocular pathologies, such as corneal pathologies, cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration.

Abstract:In the eye, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is not known to contribute to visual perception but to mainly damage multiple structures. UVR carries higher energy than visible light and high dose exposure to UVR causes direct cellular damage, which has an important role in the development of cancer. This review provides an overview on the most recent knowledge on the role of UVR in oxidative stress (OS) in relation to noncancer ocular pathologies: various corneal pathologies, cataract, glaucoma and age‐related macular degeneration. Possible OS signaling streams and mechanisms in the aging eye are discussed. Excessive exposure to UVR through live may seriously contribute to increase in OS of various eye tissues and thus lead to the advancement of serious ocular pathologies. Children are especially vulnerable to UVR because of their larger pupils and more transparent ocular media: up to 80% of a person's lifetime exposure to UVR is reached before the age of 18. Therefore, efficient everyday protection of the sensitive tissues of the eye by wearing of sunglasses, clear UVR‐blocking spectacles or contact lenses should be considered from early age on. Many initiatives are taken worldwide to inform and raise the population's awareness about these possible UVR hazards to the eye.

Key takeaways:Excessive sunlight exposure can accelerate eye aging, cataract development, and retinal degeneration.

Abstract:Excessive exposure to sunlight is harmful to our health. The effects of ultraviolet (UV) rays on the skin are commonly known, but our knowledge about the influence of sunlight on the eyes is neglected. Prolonged exposure to UVA accelerates skin ageing around the eyes. Children are more exposed to UV radiation than adults and the elderly because of their more translucent lens. In the lenses of the elderly cataract develops eas-ier, and with regard to the retina UVB is one of the risk factors for developing age-related macular degeneration. The first defensive reaction is to squint and narrow the pupils. Another filter are pigments to contained in the retina spot: lutein, and zeaxanthin. In addition, the eyes should be protected with sunglass-es or contact lenses with an approved UV filter. Above all; however, it is needed to remember about the moderate use of sunbathing and that tanning beds are recommended only for adults. People who spend a lot of time in the sun should consume a diet rich in antioxidants.

There is a strong evidence that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure is associated with the formation of eyelid malignancies , photokeratitis, climatic droplet keratopathy (CDK), pterygium, and cortical cataract. However, the evidence of the association between UV exposure and development of pinguecula, nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract, ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN), and ocular melanoma remained limited. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is related to UV exposure. It is now suggested that AMD is probably related to visible radiation especially blue light, rather than UV exposure. From the results, it was concluded that eyelid malignancies (BCC and SCC), photokeratitis, CDK, pterygium, and cortical cataract are strongly associated with UVR exposure. Evidence of the association between UV exposure and development of pinguecula, nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract, OSSN, and ocular melanoma remained limited. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether AMD is related to UV exposure. Simple behaviural changes, appropriate clothing, wearing hats, and UV blocking spectacles, sunglasses or contact lens are effective measures for UV protection.

UV light and the ocular lens: a review of exposure models and resulting biomolecular changes

Number of 

Key takeaways:Prolonged UV light exposure in the eye can lead to pathological changes and cataract development, with oxidative stress being a key factor in cataract development.

Abstract:UV light is known to cause damage to biomolecules in living tissue. Tissues of the eye that play highly specialised roles in forming our sense of sight are uniquely exposed to light of all wavelengths. While these tissues have evolved protective mechanisms to resist damage from UV wavelengths, prolonged exposure is thought to lead to pathological changes. In the lens, UV light exposure is a risk factor for the development of cataract, which is a condition that is characterised by opacity that impairs its function as a focusing element in the eye. Cataract can affect spatially distinct regions of the lens. Age-related nuclear cataract is the most prevalent form of cataract and is strongly associated with oxidative stress and a decrease in the antioxidant capacity of the central lens region. Since UV light can generate reactive oxygen species to induce oxidative stress, its effects on lens structure, transparency, and biochemistry have been extensively investigated in animal models in order to better understand human cataract aetiology. A review of the different light exposure models and the advances in mechanistic understanding gained from these models is presented.

The influence of ultraviolet radiation on the eyes and periocular skin

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive sunlight exposure accelerates eye ageing, cataract development, and retinal degeneration, and can be protected with sunglasses, contact lenses, and a diet rich in antioxidants.

Abstract:Excessive exposure to sunlight is harmful to our health. The effects of ultraviolet (UV) rays on the skin are commonly known, but our knowledge about the influence of sunlight on the eyes is neglected. Prolonged exposure to UVA accelerates skin ageing around the eyes. Children are more exposed to UV radiation than adults and the elderly because of their more translucent lens. In the lenses of the elderly cataract develops easier, and with regard to the retina UVB is one of the risk factors for developing age-related macular degeneration. The first defensive reaction is to squint and narrow the pupils. Another filter are pigments to contained in the retina spot: lutein, and zeaxanthin. In addition, the eyes should be protected with sunglasses or contact lenses with an approved UV filter. Above all; however, it is needed to remember about the moderate use of sunbathing and that tanning beds are recommended only for adults. People who spend a lot of time in the sun should consume a diet rich in antioxidants.

Effects of Solar Radiation on the Eyes

Key takeaways:Solar radiation exposure is underestimated as an occupational risk for outdoor workers, with potential side effects including cataracts, pterygium, and macular degeneration.

Abstract:It is known that exposure to solar radiation (SR) can cause various harmful effects on one's health, most of which are related to the ultraviolet (UV) component of SR. A considerably high number of people around the world who work outside are constantly exposed to SR for the majority of their working lives. The eye is the primary organ affected by short-term and long-term exposure to solar radiation. According to an ever-growing body of research, cataracts, pterygium, and macular degeneration are all possible side effects of prolonged exposure. Despite this, the danger of SR exposure is presently underestimated, if not completely overlooked, as a component of occupational risk for employees who do their duties outside. SR exposure is impacted by a wide range of individual and environmental factors; nevertheless, occupational exposure is among the most significant. The scarcity of affordable and accepted methods to measure SR worker exposure, particularly long-term exposure, is one of the key obstacles that must be overcome before a more excellent knowledge of this risk and the development of more effective preventive strategies can be accomplished. This review was conducted with the primary objectives of providing a comprehensive overview of the SR exposure risk of outdoor workers, including UV exposure extents and the chief approaches recently proposed for short-term and cumulative exposure, as well as providing an update on the information presented regarding the most common adverse eye effects. In conclusion, this article will be presenting preventative steps that may be taken to reduce occupational risk.

Ultraviolet Radiation and the Eye

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive ultraviolet radiation exposure can cause adverse consequences for the skin and eye, with personal protection measures like brimmed hats and sunglasses potentially reducing ocular UVB exposure by up to 18-fold.

Abstract:Moderate exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun is a necessary part of maintaining normal health. Ultraviolet radiation is critical for formation of VitaminD and the normal healthy growth of bones and teeth. However, excessive exposure to UVR has no health benefits and can lead to adverse consequences for the skin and eye. When the body receives excessive UVR exposure on a chronic or acute basis, the potential for cellular and tissue damage exists. Ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) is implicated in the development of periocular skin changes, such as sunburn and eyelid malignancies, and diseases of the conjunctiva, cornea, and lens. Significant advances have beenmade toward understanding the effects of UVR on the eye on a biochemical, environmental, and epidemiologic level. Each individual is exposed to a variable amount of harmful UVB, which is dependent on environmental factors such as cloud cover, lower atmospheric pollution, and the thickness of the ozone layer, geographical considerations such as latitude and altitude, temporal factors such as time of day and season, and personal behaviors such as the use of protective clothing, lotions, and eyewear. To limit exposure to UVB, the most modifiable of these factors is the use of brimmed hats and sunglasses, as personal protection measures can effectuate up to an 18-fold difference in ocular UVB exposure. Human exposure to UVR is increasing as ozone depletion and global climate changes influence surface radiation levels, life expectancy increases, and lifestyle changes lead to increased leisure activities in UV intense environments. Increased exposure to UVR has broad public health implications for ophthalmologists as an increased burden of UVrelated ocular disease is to be expected.

Key takeaways:Exposure to UV irradiation through skin or eyes reduces hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic protein expression, potentially impacting brain development and memory.

Abstract:We are exposed to sunlight that contains ultraviolet (UV) rays that are absorbed through our skin and eyes. Sunlight is responsible for the synthesis of vitamin D and maintains the balance of serotonin and melatonin (1). However, exposure to excessive sunlight causes skin cancer, and eye diseases such as UV-induced keratitis and cortical cataract. Moreover, skin exposure to UV regulates systemic homeostasis.

The Impact of Ultraviolet Radiation on Human Health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ultraviolet radiation negatively impacts human health, including skin cancer, cataracts, and photokeratitis, necessitating protective measures like sunscreen, protective clothing, and shade.

Abstract:This comprehensive review examines the significant health effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, highlighting its impact on skin and eye health, immune function, and reproductive health. Prolonged exposure to UV rays is a well-established risk factor for various forms of skin cancer, including melanoma and non-melanoma types, as well as conditions such as cataracts and photokeratitis. The mechanisms through which UV radiation exerts these harmful effects include DNA damage, oxidative stress, and immune suppression, underscoring the need for protective measures. The UV Index is introduced as a vital tool for assessing UV intensity and informing individuals about the risks associated with sun exposure. By implementing effective sun safety strategies, such as using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and seeking shade, individuals can significantly mitigate their risk of UV-related health issues. As the understanding of UV radiation’s health effects continues to evolve, public awareness and education remain crucial in promoting long-term skin and eye health, as well as overall well-being. This review emphasizes the importance of proactive measures in protecting against the growing risks associated with increased UV exposure in today’s environment.

Exposure to Solar Ultraviolet Radiation on Earth

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive exposure to solar UV radiation can cause serious health effects on our skin, eyes, and immune system, with cumulative adverse effects on human health.

Abstract:About 95 % of total solar radiation reaching Earth's surface comprises of visible (380 to 750 nanometers, nm wavelengths) and infrared (700 to 1 x 106 nm wavelengths) regions of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. Remaining 5 % of total solar radiation reaching Earth's surface comprises of ultraviolet (UV) (100 to 400 nm wavelengths) region of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. The UV region of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum is divided into three bands, namely UVA band between 315 and 400 nm wavelengths, UVB band between 280 and 315 nm wavelengths and UVC band between 100 and 280 nm wavelengths. Excessive exposure to solar UV radiation can cause very serious health effects on our skin, i.e. skin cancer, to our eyes, i.e. cataracts, and to our immune system. Also, exposure to solar UV radiation has cumulative adverse effect on human health.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher exposure to ultraviolet radiation increases the prevalence of eye diseases, which in turn shapes institutional quality across countries.

Abstract:Higher exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV‐R) is associated with greater prevalence of eye disease such as cataracts. We hypothesize that the variation in the intensity of UV‐R can help explain the differences in institutional quality observed across countries. The long‐term incentive and ability to improve the quality of institutions decline when the probability of blindness increases. Our reduced‐form cross‐country results support this hypothesis. We then propose that the mechanism works from the impact of UV‐R on the prevalence of eye disease, which in turn shapes institutions. Our empirical evidence lends considerable support to this hypothesis.

Health Risks Associated With Excessive Exposure to Solar Ultraviolet Radiation Among Outdoor Workers in South Africa: An Overview

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive solar UVR exposure in South Africa poses significant health risks, including skin cancer and eye diseases, and requires legislation and sun safety guidelines to address these gaps.

Abstract:Exposure of outdoor workers to high levels of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) poses significant, well-known health risks including skin cancer and eye diseases. In South Africa, little is known about how many workers are potentially overexposed to solar UVR and what the associated impacts on their health might be. In this overview, the geography and solar UVR environment in South Africa are considered, as well as the different outdoor occupational groups likely to be affected by excessive solar UVR exposure. Sunburn, pterygium, cataract, keratinocyte cancers, and melanoma are discussed in the context of outdoor workers. Few studies in South Africa have considered these health issues and the most effective ways to reduce solar UVR exposure for those working outside. Several countries have developed policies and guidelines to support sun safety in the workplace which include training and education, in addition to the provision of personal protective equipment and managerial support. Several gaps in occupational sun protection and workplace sun safety for South Africa are identified. Legislation needs to recognize solar UVR exposure as an occupational health hazard, with sun safety guidelines and training provided for employers and employees.

The human health effects of ozone depletion and interactions with climate change

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ozone depletion increases solar UV-B radiation, leading to increased skin cancer rates and eye damage, while vitamin D production offers health benefits.

Abstract:Depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer has led to increased solar UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) at the surface of the Earth. This change is likely to have had an impact on human exposure to UV-B radiation with consequential detrimental and beneficial effects on health, although behavioural changes in society over the past 60 years or so with regard to sun exposure are of considerable importance. The present report concentrates on information published since our previous report in 2007. The adverse effects of UV radiation are primarily on the eye and the skin. While solar UV radiation is a recognised risk factor for some types of cataract and for pterygium, the evidence is less strong, although increasing, for ocular melanoma, and is equivocal at present for age-related macular degeneration. For the skin, the most common harmful outcome is skin cancer, including melanoma and the non-melanoma skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The incidence of all three of these tumours has risen significantly over the past five decades, particularly in people with fair skin, and is projected to continue to increase, thus posing a significant world-wide health burden. Overexposure to the sun is the major identified environmental risk factor in skin cancer, in association with various genetic risk factors and immune effects. Suppression of some aspects of immunity follows exposure to UV radiation and the consequences of this modulation for the immune control of infectious diseases, for vaccination and for tumours, are additional concerns. In a common sun allergy (polymorphic light eruption), there is an imbalance in the immune response to UV radiation, resulting in a sun-evoked rash. The major health benefit of exposure to solar UV-B radiation is the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in bone metabolism and is also implicated in protection against a wide range of diseases. Although there is some evidence supporting protective effects for a range of internal cancers, this is not yet conclusive, but strongest for colorectal cancer, at present. A role for vitamin D in protection against several autoimmune diseases has been studied, with the most convincing results to date for multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D is starting to be assessed for its protective properties against several infectious and coronary diseases. Current methods for protecting the eye and the skin from the adverse effects of solar UV radiation are evaluated, including seeking shade, wearing protective clothing and sunglasses, and using sunscreens. Newer possibilities are considered such as creams that repair UV-induced DNA damage, and substances applied topically to the skin or eaten in the diet that protect against some of the detrimental effects of sun exposure. It is difficult to provide easily understandable public health messages regarding “safe” sun exposure, so that the positive effects of vitamin D production are balanced against the negative effects of excessive exposure. The international response to ozone depletion has included the development and deployment of replacement technologies and chemicals. To date, limited evidence suggests that substitutes for the ozone-depleting substances do not have significant effects on human health. In addition to stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change is predicted to affect human health, and potential interactions between these two parameters are considered. These include altering the risk of developing skin tumours, infectious diseases and various skin diseases, in addition to altering the efficiency by which pathogenic microorganisms are inactivated in the environment.

The effects on human health from stratospheric ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ozone depletion increases solar UVR, leading to eye damage, skin cancer, and immune suppression, but also contributes to vitamin D synthesis and may protect against autoimmune diseases.

Abstract:Ozone depletion leads to an increase in the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) component (280-315 nm) of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the surface of the Earth with important consequences for human health. Solar UVR has many harmful and some beneficial effects on individuals and, in this review, information mainly published since the previous report in 2003 (F. R. de Gruijl, J. Longstreth, M. Norval, A. P. Cullen, H. Slaper, M. L. Kripke, Y. Takizawa and J. C. van der Leun, Photochem. Photobiol. Sci ., 2003, 2 , pp. 16-28) is discussed. The eye is exposed directly to sunlight and this can result in acute or long-term damage. Studying how UV-B interacts with the surface and internal structures of the eye has led to a further understanding of the location and pathogenesis of a number of ocular diseases, including pterygium and cataract. The skin is also exposed directly to solar UVR, and the development of skin cancer is the main adverse health outcome of excessive UVR exposure. Skin cancer is the most common form of malignancy amongst fair-skinned people, and its incidence has increased markedly in recent decades. Projections consistently indicate a further doubling in the next ten years. It is recognised that genetic factors in addition to those controlling pigment variation can modulate the response of an individual to UVR. Several of the genetic factors affecting susceptibility to the development of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma have been identified. Exposure to solar UVR down-regulates immune responses, in the skin and systemically, by a combination of mechanisms including the generation of particularly potent subsets of T regulatory cells. Such immunosuppression is known to be a crucial factor in the generation of skin cancers. Apart from a detrimental effect on infections caused by some members of the herpesvirus and papillomavirus families, the impact of UV-induced immunosuppression on other microbial diseases and vaccination efficacy is not clear. One important beneficial effect of solar UV-B is its contribution to the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D, recognised to be a crucial hormone for bone health and for other aspects of general health. There is accumulating evidence that UVR exposure, either directly or via stimulation of vitamin D production, has protective effects on the development of some autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. Adequate vitamin D may also be protective for the development of several internal cancers and infections. Difficulties associated with balancing the positive effects of vitamin D with the negative effects of too much exposure to solar UV-B are considered. Various strategies that can be adopted by the individual to protect against excessive exposure of the eye or the skin to sunlight are suggested. Finally, possible interactions between ozone depletion and climate warming are outlined briefly, as well as how these might influence human behaviour with regard to sun exposure.

Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure: Some Observations and Considerations, Focusing on Some Italian Experiences, on Cancer Risk, and Primary Prevention

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ultraviolet radiation exposure, both occupational and recreational, increases skin cancer risk, and effective prevention strategies are crucial for both outdoor workers and the general population exposed to UVR.

Abstract:Solar ultraviolet radiation may cause acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and also on the immune system. Actinic keratosis, non-melanoma skin cancers, and malignant melanoma are the main long-term adverse skin effects. In the white population, the most common type of cancer worldwide is skin cancer, and the incidence of this cancer has increased during the last decades. The most important risk factor responsible for this trend seems to be Ultraviolet Radiation (UVR). IARC has classified UVR as being carcinogenic to humans. UV radiation exposure is ubiquitous; to study skin cancer risk, it is important to take into account the fact that UV exposure may occur both for occupational activities but also during vacation or recreational activities. Furthermore, exposure to artificial UVR such as those emitted by artificial devices, classified by IARC as carcinogenic to humans, is also to be considered. Due to the prominent role of UVR, primary prevention of skin cancer is very suitable, because when following specific rules this risk factor can be reduced. The incidence rate of skin cancer is higher in people with fair skin. Outdoor workers exposed to solar UVR are at risk of developing skin cancer, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers, and welders exposed to artificial UVR are at risk of developing ocular melanoma. A specific project on solar UVR risk in outdoor workers in Tuscany, Italy, has shown that outdoor workers had an unsatisfactory sun protection behaviour. The project demonstrates the complexity of studying UVR exposure and recommended the need for prevention programs. Risk increases with increasing ambient solar radiation and with unsafe behaviours in the sun or when using artificial UVR (e.g., sunbeds). Effective prevention strategies have to be adopted both for the outdoor workers and for the general population exposed to UVR. A standardized program of proven efficacy, such as that implemented in Australia, should also be implemented in other countries. All these strategies could contribute to the aim of decreasing the morbidity and mortality of cancers associated with this exposure. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of UVR exposure risk, particularly occupational risk, and to give some elements to understand the complexity of the relation between UVR exposure and cancer risk, as well as to outline primary prevention measures, focusing also on Italian experiences that could be useful for providing additional elements of knowledge on this topic.

Workplace exposure to UV radiation and strategies to minimize cancer risk

Number of 

Key takeaways:Workplace exposure to solar UV can cause skin cancer, but there is evidence for reduced risks for other cancers, and employers should manage these risks to minimize cancer risk.

Abstract:Abstract Background Workplace exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) causes malignant melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The evidence for beneficial effects of solar UV exposure in reducing the risks for other cancers is increasing. The intensity of UV radiation at the Earth’s surface is dependent on latitude, but even in northern European countries exposure can be high enough for outdoor work to cause skin cancer. Growing points Awareness of the health risks and benefits of occupational solar UV exposure is poor. Actions to reduce the risk of skin cancer have been identified and employers should recognize their responsibility to actively manage these risks. There is evidence for reduced risks for breast, ovarian and colorectal cancer and possibly other cancers linked to solar UV exposure. Sources of data This narrative review draws on published scientific articles and material designed to assist identifying strategies to protect workers from solar UV exposure. Areas of agreement Solar UV exposure can be harmful. Wavelengths in the UVB range are more effective in causing erythema and DNA damage. Solar UV is the main source of vitamin D for most people. Primary and secondary prevention for skin cancer can potentially eliminate these risks but the evidence for effectiveness is limited. Areas of controversy Potential health benefits of UV exposure, particularly for reduced cancer risk. Determining and communicating optimal exposure to maximize health benefits. The risk of non-melanoma skin cancers may be more than doubled for some workers in temperate latitudes. Areas timely for developing research Exposure-response epidemiological studies; studies of the health benefits of occupational UV exposure; studies of the effectiveness of intervention strategies to prevent skin cancer. Use of low-cost UV sensors in workplaces.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ultraviolet radiation is the main risk factor for skin cancer, and regular skin check-ups, suitable textile protection, and sunscreens are crucial for preventing cancer development.

Abstract:Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main risk factor for the development of melanocytic and nonmelanocytic skin cancer. UVA and UVB radiation are of particular importance in photocarcinogenesis. Depending on the wavelength, mechanisms of tumor initiation and promotion include direct DNA damage and proinflammatory processes. In recent years, the number of skin cancer cases in Germany has continuously increased. In addition to regular skin check-ups, use of suitable textile protection and sunscreens play a central role in the prevention of cancer development. As dermatologists, it is our task to regularly inform our patients about the consequences of excessive sun exposure and to adequately inform them about necessary protective devices.

Deciphering UV‐induced DNA Damage Responses to Prevent and Treat Skin Cancer

Number of 

Key takeaways:UV-induced DNA damage responses can be used to prevent and treat nonmelanoma skin cancer, with current strategies including ATR pathway inhibition and photodynamic therapy.

Abstract:Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is among the most prevalent environmental factors that influence human health and disease. Even 1 h of UV irradiation extensively damages the genome. To cope with resulting deleterious DNA lesions, cells activate a multitude of DNA damage response pathways, including DNA repair. Strikingly, UV‐induced DNA damage formation and repair are affected by chromatin state. When cells enter S phase with these lesions, a distinct mutation signature is created via error‐prone translesion synthesis. Chronic UV exposure leads to high mutation burden in skin and consequently the development of skin cancer, the most common cancer in the United States. Intriguingly, UV‐induced oxidative stress has opposing effects on carcinogenesis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of UV‐induced DNA damage responses will be useful for preventing and treating skin cancer with greater precision. Excitingly, recent studies have uncovered substantial depth of novel findings regarding the molecular and cellular consequences of UV irradiation. In this review, we will discuss updated mechanisms of UV‐induced DNA damage responses including the ATR pathway, which maintains genome integrity following UV irradiation. We will also present current strategies for preventing and treating nonmelanoma skin cancer, including ATR pathway inhibition for prevention and photodynamic therapy for treatment.

Chronic UV radiation–induced RORγt+ IL-22–producing lymphoid cells are associated with mutant KC clonal expansion

Number of 

Key takeaways:Chronic UV exposure leads to RORt+ IL-22-producing lymphoid cells, which can be targeted for skin cancer prevention by inhibiting these immune cells.

Abstract:Significance Ultraviolet (UV) exposure from the sun is the greatest risk factor for skin cancer. Toward preventive strategies, we elucidated the immune pathways critical to skin cancer development and identified specific cells and signals associated with mutated skin cell growth. UV light and Langerhans cells cooperate to induce lymphoid cells that produce interleukin-22 locally and are associated with mutant skin cell growth. This effect is highly dependent on the differentiation factor RORγt that can be inhibited with a topical agent. Such skin cancer–supporting immune cells were identified with distinctive markers: RORγt+ Sca-1+ CD103+ ICOS+ CD2+/− CCR6+ intracellular CD3+. Together, these data elucidate key immune components of UV-induced skin cancer that may represent targets for skin cancer prevention. Chronic ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is the greatest risk factor for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) development, and compromised immunity accelerates this risk. Having previously identified that epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) facilitate the expansion of UV-induced mutant keratinocytes (KC), we sought to more fully elucidate the immune pathways critical to cutaneous carcinogenesis and to identify potential targets of intervention. Herein, we reveal that chronic UV induces and LC enhance a local immune shift toward RORγt+ interleukin (IL)-22/IL-17A–producing cells that occurs in the presence or absence of T cells while identifying a distinct RORγt+ Sca-1+ CD103+ ICOS+ CD2+/− CCR6+ intracellular CD3+ cutaneous innate lymphoid cell type-3 (ILC3) population (uvILC3) that is associated with UV-induced mutant KC growth. We further show that mutant KC clone size is markedly reduced in the absence of RORγt+ lymphocytes or IL-22, both observed in association with expanding KC clones, and find that topical application of a RORγ/γt inhibitor during chronic UV exposure reduces local expression of IL-22 and IL-17A while markedly limiting mutant p53 KC clonal expansion. We implicate upstream Toll-like receptor signaling in driving this immune response to chronic UV exposure, as MyD88/Trif double-deficient mice also show substantially reduced p53 island number and size. These data elucidate key immune components of chronic UV–induced cutaneous carcinogenesis that might represent targets for skin cancer prevention.

Ageing research: rethinking primary prevention of skin cancer

Number of 

Key takeaways:Current primary prevention measures, focusing on UV-protection, may not be sufficient to address the rising skin cancer risk in ageing societies.

Abstract:Nobody will argue the need for effective primary prevention of skin cancers, the most common of cancers in humans with light skin tone. Numerous campaigns, investigations and studies, mainly focusing on UV-protection, have been conducted with the noble goal of reducing morbidity, mortality and the socioeconomic burden of cutaneous malignancies. Yet, can we claim a significant impact? While educational and behavioural interventions are believed to be the cornerstone of effective primary prevention, efficacy and long-term outcomes are controversial. Efforts to improve, for example, the reach of and adherence to UV-protective measures range from simply banning artificial UV-sources like tanning beds for minors, and legally binding regulations for outdoor workers with excessive UV-exposure in some countries, to targeted social media adds and gamified face-apps individually predicting and visualizing the impact of UV-radiation over time. However, there is no reason to believe that any of the current measures, as astute as they may be, will be sufficient to address the foreseen sweeping rise of skin cancers, particularly in ageing societies. As highlighted in Fig. 1, preventing the negative effects of UV-radiation is both important and actionable; however, external noxa are only one piece to the skin cancer puzzle. Epidemiological studies and data from national registries call out that older age is the greatest risk factor for skin cancers. While one can argue that old age is a surrogate for cumulative exogenous skin damage, there is mounting evidence that biological processes of skin ageing, which are independent of external factors, also play a substantial role in skin carcinogenesis. This commentary aims at being thought-provoking. It touches on selected endogenously triggered biological processes linked to ageing and cancer in view of potential future interventions for primary skin cancer prevention.

UV Radiation in DNA Damage and Repair Involving DNA-Photolyases and Cryptochromes

Number of 

Key takeaways:UV radiation can cause DNA damage and repair, with DNA photolyases and cryptochromes playing a role in preventing and treating diseases caused by UV radiation.

Abstract:Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation on human skin can lead to mutations in DNA, photoaging, suppression of the immune system, and other damage up to skin cancer (melanoma, basal cell, and squamous cell carcinoma). We reviewed the state of knowledge of the damaging action of UVB and UVA on DNA, and also the mechanisms of DNA repair with the participation of the DNA-photolyase enzyme or of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system. In the course of evolution, most mammals lost the possibility of DNA photoreparation due to the disappearance of DNA photolyase genes, but they retained closely related cryptochromes that regulate the transcription of the NER system enzymes. We analyze the published relationships between DNA photolyases/cryptochromes and carcinogenesis, as well as their possible role in the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by UV radiation.

Ultraviolet Radiation and Basal Cell Carcinoma: An Environmental Perspective

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ultraviolet radiation exposure, particularly UVB, is a significant environmental risk factor for basal cell carcinoma development, promoting uncontrolled skin cell replication and influencing the tumor microenvironment through DNA damage and inflammatory responses.

Abstract:Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a known carcinogen participated for the development of skin cancers. Solar UVR exposure, particularly ultraviolet B (UVB), is the mostly significant environmental risk factor for the occurrence and progress of basal cell carcinoma(BCC). Both cumulative and intermittent high-grade UVR exposure could promote the uncontrolled replication of skin cells. There are also exsiting other contributing environmental factors that combine with the UVR exposure to promote the development of BCC. DNA damage in formation of skin cancers is considered to be a result of UVR toxicity. It is UVR that could activate a series of oncogenes simultaneously inactivating tumor suppressor genes and aberrant proliferation and survival of keratinocytes that repair these damages. Furthermore, mounting evidence demonstrates that inflammatory responses of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment plays crucial role in the skin tumorigenesis as well. In this chapter, we will follow the function of UVR in the onset and development of BCC. We describe the factors that influence BCC induced by UVR, and also review the recent advances of pathogenesis of BCC induced by UVR from the genetic and inflammatory aspects.

Improved protection of outdoor workers from solar ultraviolet radiation: position statement

Number of 

Key takeaways:Outdoor workers face significant skin cancer risks due to excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and improved protection through legally binding rules and regulations is crucial for reducing these risks.

Abstract:The vast majority of non‐melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is attributable to excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Outdoor workers are exposed to an UVR dose at least 2 to 3 times higher than indoor workers and often to daily UVR doses 5 times above internationally recommended limits. The risk of UVR workplace exposure is vastly neglected, and the evident future challenges presented in this statement are contrasted with the current situation regarding legal recognition, patient care and compensation. While prevention is crucial to reduce cancer risks for outdoor workers, it is as much of relevance to better protect them through legally binding rules and regulations. Specific actions are outlined in five recommendations based on a Call to Action (table 1). The role of health professionals, including dermatologists, in this context is crucial.

Occupational skin cancer induced by ultraviolet radiation and its prevention

Number of 

Key takeaways:Occupational UV radiation exposure is a significant risk factor for developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, and effective prevention strategies include awareness, protective clothing, and regular sunscreen use.

Abstract:Skin cancer is by far the most common kind of cancer diagnosed in many western countries and ultraviolet radiation is the most important risk factor for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Although employees at several workplaces are exposed to increased levels of UV radiation, skin cancer due to long‐term intense occupational exposure to UV radiation is often not considered as occupational disease. The actually available evidence in the epidemiological literature clearly indicates that occupational UV radiation exposure is a substantial and robust risk factor for the development of cutaneous SCC and also clearly shows a significant risk for developing BCC. There is enough scientific evidence that outdoor workers have an increased risk of developing work‐related occupational skin cancer due to natural UV radiation exposure and adequate prevention strategies must be implemented. The three measures which are successful and of particular importance in the prevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer in outdoor workers are changes in behaviour regarding awareness of health and disease resulting from exposure to natural UV radiation, protection from direct UV radiation by wearing suitable clothing, and regular and correct use of appropriate sunscreens.

Abstract:Simple Summary Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for skin cancer. Melanoma is the most life-threatening type of skin cancer. UV-induced DNA damage and oxidative stress represent two main mechanisms that, directly and indirectly, contribute to melanomagenesis. In addition, an interplay of abnormally expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) and redox imbalance is a hallmark in several cancers, including melanoma. UV radiation can be the central hub between these two cellular aberrations, as it is able to stimulate both. Here, to gain new mechanistic insights into melanomagenesis and identify new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of melanoma, we report current evidence suggesting a complex interaction between UV-promoted deregulation of redox-sensitive miRNAs and known signal-transduction pathways underlying malignant transformation of melanocytes to melanoma. Abstract Melanoma is the most aggressive and life-threatening form of skin cancer. Key molecular events underlying the melanocytic transformation into malignant melanoma mainly involve gene mutations in which exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a prominent role. However, several aspects of UV-induced melanomagenesis remain to be explored. Interestingly, redox-mediated signaling and perturbed microRNA (miRNA) profiles appear to be interconnected contributing factors able to act synergistically in melanoma initiation and progression. Since UV radiation can promote both redox imbalance and miRNA dysregulation, a harmful crosstalk between these two key cellular networks, with UV as central hub among them, is likely to occur in skin tissue. Therefore, decoding the complex circuits that orchestrate the interaction of UV exposure, oxidative stress, and dysregulated miRNA profiling can provide a deep understanding of the molecular basis of the melanomagenesis process. Furthermore, these mechanistic insights into the reciprocal regulation between these systems could have relevant implications for future therapeutic approaches aimed at counteracting UV-induced redox and miRNome imbalances for the prevention and treatment of malignant melanoma. In this review, we illustrate current information on the intricate connection between UV-induced dysregulation of redox-sensitive miRNAs and well-known signaling pathways involved in the malignant transformation of normal melanocytes to malignant melanoma.

The economics of skin cancer prevention with implications for Australia and New Zealand: where are we now?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Primary prevention of skin cancers, primarily due to harmful UV exposure, offers significant economic benefits for governments and citizens, but more research is needed to accurately assess true savings.

Abstract:The incidence of skin cancer, including melanoma, continues to climb in white populations around the world, imposing a large and growing burden on health systems and individuals. Harmful exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, mostly solar UV, is the most avoidable cause of skin cancer risk and mortality. Many economic evaluations attest to the favourable benefits for governments and citizens from skin cancer prevention programs. This overview presents the current 'state of play' of the economics of skin cancer prevention. More research is required to document contemporary costs of managing skin cancer in Australia and New Zealand to accurately assess the true savings from primary prevention. New directions are proposed for ways that economics could contribute to the investment case for prevention. The majority of skin cancers are avoidable and curable, yet cost the Australian health economy A$1.7 billion each year. Therefore primary prevention of skin cancers must remain high on the public health agenda.

Key takeaways:Excessive UVR exposure, particularly UV-B radiation, increases the risk of developing skin cancer in outdoor workers, particularly in areas with high UV radiation exposure.

Abstract:Background: Skin is the outermost covering of the human body that serves as a barrier from extrinsic etiological challenges including physical, chemical and biological insults. Ultraviolet (UV)-B (280–320 nm) is the lead environmental agent responsible for causing skin pathologies, overexposure of ultraviolet radiation, particularly UV-B radiations, due to high energy and shorter wave length which are causes for most of the pathological states of skin. Skin cancers are classified into two main categories, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and cutaneous melanoma (CM). While melanoma originates through the transformation of melanocytes, NMSC arises from other epidermal cells, mainly keratinocytes, are subdivided into basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Skin cancers are considered to be one of the most preventable malignancies. By protecting the skin and limiting the amount of unprotected exposure to UVR, skin cancer risk can be decreased. Objective: To describe the demographic and clinical features of skin cancer and evaluate the harmful effects of excess UVR exposure on human skin. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional stud was conducted at the dermatology department in Baquba teaching hospital in Diyala, Iraq. A total of 100 patients were included, in the study, who attended the outpatient clinic of dermatology department of Baquba teaching hospital, from first of September 2020 to end May 2021. Results: A total of 100 patients diagnosed as skin cancer, were eligible for the study, aged between 30-80 years, The majority of them aged 41-50 years (39%), 50% of them were males and 50% were females, The majority of the patients, were laborer (31%), and 22% of them were housewives, Regarding residence, the majority of the patients (32%) lived in Kalar, and 27% resided in the Baquba, while just 3% from Mendeley, 83%percent of the patients, had white skin while just 17% of them had brown skin, and no one had black skin color, Regarding the affected site of the body, the face was the most common affected site of the body, found in (52%) of the patients. While face and neck were the most common affected site in 35% of the patients, and the least affected site was the face and hand found in 4% of the patients. Of the total patients, 99% were exposed to normal light while just 1% exposed to additional artificial light. Most of the patients (65%) said that they were exposed to the light over, all the season, while 24% of them were exposed to light just in summer, 8% and 3% of them were exposed in spring, summer and spring respectively. No one was exposed to light in autumn or winter, Just 4% of the patients had family history of skin cancer. There were 79% of the patients diagnosed as basal cell carcinoma; 14% had actinic keratosis, 5% had sun burn; and 2% had seborrheic keratosis. Regarding the patients with (BCC), most of the patients aged less than 70 years. Females were 50.6% of the patients with BCC, while males were 49.4%. The mean age of females was (53.6±12.9 years) was the same for males (53.6±11.6 years), females were affected by BCC in < 50 and ≥70 age group more than males, while males were affected more in 50-69 age group. Sixty-five percent of the patients had white skin while just 14% of them had brown skin. Regarding the affected site of the body, the face was the most common affected site of the body, found in (53.2%) of the patients, while face and neck were the most common affected site in 34.2% of the patients, and the least affected site was the face and hand found in 5.1% of the patients. Conclusion:Outdoor workers, especially those without protective measures, and in high altitude areas, are more liable to develop skin cancer especially basal cell carcinoma, so it is important to use sun-protective measures.
