Excessive porn consumption

Frequent and excessive pornography consumption is associated with deteriorating mental health and changes in brain function

Excessive consumption of pornographic content is a phenomenon increasingly observed in societies with widespread internet access. Scientific studies indicate that regular and intensive use of pornography may lead to negative psychological consequences such as an increased risk of depression, anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and problematic compulsive behaviors. This phenomenon particularly concerns young people and individuals with increased psychological vulnerability.

Level of evidence:Good

Exposure to pornographic content strongly activates the brain's reward system, which may lead to the development of compulsive behaviors and difficulties with impulse control. These changes involve both neural plasticity in areas responsible for motivation and disturbances in the functioning of the prefrontal cortex, which is crucial for self-control and decision-making. Excessive use of pornography may impair working memory, concentration, and result in reduced mental well-being.

The harmfulness of excessive consumption of pornographic content has been confirmed in many scientific studies, systematic reviews, and neurobiological analyses. Regular and intensive pornography use may lead to:

The scale of the problem of excessive pornography consumption is growing, particularly affecting adolescents and young adults. Key observations include:

Recognize your own consumption patterns

Pay attention to how often and under what circumstances you access pornographic content. Awareness of your own habits is the first step toward change.

Create a reduction or elimination plan

Set specific time limits or situations in which you choose to abstain from viewing pornography. Use digital tools to help control access.

Recognize situations, emotions, or stimuli that lead to excessive consumption. Look for healthier ways to cope with stress and boredom.

Introduce alternative activities

Replace time spent watching pornography with other activities: sports, socializing with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or personal development.

Seek professional help

If you notice symptoms of addiction or difficulties controlling your behavior, consider consulting a psychologist or therapist specializing in behavioral addictions.

Excessive consumption of pornographic content negatively affects mental health, especially among youth and those prone to problematic use. The strongest evidence indicates increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, risk of addiction, and lowered self-esteem.

Final comment:Most available scientific studies on excessive consumption of pornographic content in humans are based on well-designed observational studies, numerous systematic reviews, and a few meta-analyses. There is a consistent and replicable correlation between excessive pornography use and negative mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety, reduced self-esteem, compulsive behaviors) as well as changes in brain function and structure. Although correlational data dominate the literature and the number of large randomized studies is limited, multifaceted findings—including neuroimaging studies—consistently confirm these associations in both young and adult populations. Further research with higher methodological quality is needed, especially to better establish causality and long-term effects; however, the current state of knowledge allows for a clear assessment based on robust evidence.

Effects of pornography consumption on the mental health of adolescents: a literature review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography exposure in adolescents is significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and risky sexual behaviors.

Abstract:Introduction: In today's digital era, access to pornography has increased, prompting several governments to regulate minors' access to this content. This literature review explores the relationship between pornography consumption and mental health issues in adolescents, aiming to synthesize the evidence and guide future public policies.

Methods: A bibliographic review was conducted following the PRISMA methodology. The literature search was carried out in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, WoS, and CINAHL. Articles published between 2019 and 2024 were included.

Results: Out of 236 identified articles, 10 studies were finally included in the review. The findings reveal a significant association between pornography exposure and an increase in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and risky sexual behaviors. Variations were also observed based on gender and cultural context.

Conclusions: Watching pornography has a negative impact on adolescents' mental health, especially when exposure to such content is intentional. Future research should continue exploring the neurophysiological mechanisms of pornography addiction, new diagnostic methods, and ways to reduce reporting bias. It is crucial to develop sexual education programs that enable adolescents to safely manage exposure to this type of content and to review public policies.

Pornography Consumption and Cognitive-Affective Distress

Number of 

Key takeaways:Internet pornography consumption is strongly linked to psychological distress, including stress, anxiety, and depression, and may serve as a defense mechanism against stress and internal conflict.

Abstract:Abstract According to recent studies, the growing consumption of Internet pornography mainly in male population becomes an increasing problem, which is closely linked to compulsive sexual behavior. Some findings also suggest that Internet pornography consumption might represent a defense mechanism against excessive stress, which enables to cope with stressful events, helps in mood regulation, and decreases depression and anxiety. Users of online pornography involved in these activities also reported that their self-exposition to pornographic material may create guilty feelings and internal conflict in themselves with respect to their own “involuntary” sexual behavior, which suggest that psychosocial stress and possibly traumatic experiences may play a significant role in Internet pornography addiction. Taken together, these findings show that stressful experiences, anxiety, and depression are strongly related to pornography consumption. In addition, conflicting emotional experiences as well as identity problems significantly increase vulnerability to addictive sexual behavior and pornography consumption.

Is pornography use a risk for adolescent well-being? An examination of temporal relationships in two independent panel samples

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography use may have antagonistic links with mental well-being in adolescent women, but not with male adolescents' psychological well-being.

Abstract:Cross-sectional evidence suggests that pornography use is related to lower mental well-being among adolescents but it remains unclear if changes in well-being are related to the dynamics of pornography use within this population. We examined the relationship between pornography use, subjective well-being, symptoms of depressions and anxiety, and self-esteem in two independent panel samples (N = 455; N = 858) of Croatian adolescents using cross-lagged path analysis and lagged linear mixed models. After controlling for impulsiveness and family environment-factors that are unlikely to be influenced by pornography use-earlier levels of pornography use were not significantly associated with subsequent decreases in subjective well-being across gender and panel. However, pornography use was associated with increases in both self-esteem and symptoms of depression and anxiety, albeit only among adolescent women in one of the two panels. In addition, low subjective well-being was associated with a subsequent increase in pornography use, but only in female adolescents in one panel. This study's results are not consistent with concerns about pornography use negatively contributing to male adolescents' psychological well-being, but suggest potential antagonistic links between pornography use and specific facets of mental well-being in adolescent women. Such links should be considered tentative until verified with further research.

Problematic Pornography Use and Mental Health: A Systematic Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Problematic pornography use (PPU) is not clearly linked to mental health outcomes, with other factors like loneliness, anxiety, and self-esteem playing a mediating role.

Abstract:Abstract The present review aimed to synthesize the empirical evidence regarding the association between problematic pornography use (PPU) and mental health. A comprehensive literature search using keywords and subject headings was performed with three electronic databases, resulting in 20 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The patterns of association between PPU and mental health were examined, and the limitations of these studies were discussed. The overall findings suggest the relationship between PPU and mental health outcomes is not clear-cut, and it is often mediated by other factors such as loneliness, anxiety, and self-esteem. Further studies are required to evaluate the prevalence of PPU and both risk and protective factors which are associated with exposure to online pornography. Most studies relied on homogenous samples which have limited the generalizability of findings. The use of representative samples, including both males and females with different sexual orientations and from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, would strengthen our understanding of PPU and go further to expound on its controversies. Clinical recommendations and future directions are also discussed.

Aggravation of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Due to Excessive Porn Consumption: A Case Report

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive porn consumption can exacerbate obsessive-compulsive disorder, leading to repetitive cleaning activities and requiring pharmacological and behavioral therapy.

Abstract:The past few decades have seen a significant rise in pornography consumption. This has brought into existence a new behavioral addiction, addiction to internet pornography, which impacts the psycho-somatic health of the individuals and people around them. The accessibility, affordability, and anonymity of online pornography have fed the growing popularity of online pornography. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) has included pornography in Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder with it being categorized as an impulse control disorder and not necessarily an addictive disorder. However, the recently published Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) does not recognize a diagnosis of sexual addiction/compulsion (including internet pornography). Psychiatry remains an ever-evolving branch, and as the understanding evolves, the schools of thought change as well. The constantly evolving literature on behavioral addictions has helped the understanding that any source capable of stimulating the reward circuitry in an individual can become addictive. The stigma associated with behavioral addictions, particularly pornographic addiction, as well as a lack of awareness, contribute to under-reporting, making the reported cases just the tip of the iceberg. Addictions have been associated with various complications and other psychiatric phenomena. We describe a case of a 28-year-old male with mild features of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that took major shape with the advent of pornographic addiction. The patient was a known case of exam anxiety, panic attacks, auditory hallucinations, and mild obsessive and compulsive symptoms. However, with the death of his girlfriend’s father, a breakup with his girlfriend, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), he indulged in porn consumption which soon shifted to religious pornographic content leading to guilt with a fair insight. This later culminated in the aggravation of his OCD with repetitive cleaning activities. The patient was started on pharmacological and behavioral therapy and has responded well in follow-ups. In light of the special presentation of this case, we strongly recommend better reporting of such complications aiding in broadening the understanding of the spectrum of possible psychiatric impacts of pornographic consumption.

Key takeaways:Early exposure to pornographic content negatively impacts the emotional health of undergraduates at Adeleke and Redeemer's Universities in Osun State.

Abstract:This study investigated the influence of early exposure to pornographic content on the emotional health of undergraduates of Adeleke and Redeemer’s Universities, Ede Osun State. It examines the level of exposure of undergraduates of Adeleke and Redeemer’s Universities to pornographic content, assesses the extent to which undergraduates of Adeleke and Redeemer’s Uni-versities practice behaviors generated from viewing such content, and examines the influence that pornographic contents have on their emotional health. Relevant literatures were reviewed. Survey research design was used. The population of the study was 7527 students of Adeleke and Redeemer’s Universities. A sample size of 380 was determined through Slovin’s formula (1967) using purposive sampling technique. Data was collected through the use of questionnaire and analysed using descriptive analysis. Findings revealed that Adeleke and Redeemer’s Universities students’ exposure to por-nographic films is frequently on monthly basis. Their monthly exposure has led to an unending chain of addiction that becomes difficult to break free from. This has led to negative influence on their emotional health. It concludes that Adeleke and Redeemer’s University students’ exposure to porno-graphic films led to an unending chain of addiction that becomes difficult to break free from and have negative influence on their emotional health.

Pengaruh Konten Pornografi Terhadap Kesehatan Otak dan Mental dalam Perspektif Islam

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography is harmful to mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being, and should be avoided for both health and Islamic reasons.

Abstract:This study discusses the effects of pornographic content on brain and mental health from an Islamic perspective, by reviewing various scientific literature and the opinions of scholars. From a neurological perspective, pornography causes changes in brain structure, especially in areas that regulate self-control and decision-making, which are similar to the effects of addiction to addictive substances. In addition, impaired short-term memory function and decreased ability to focus are also common effects of pornography consumption. From a psychological perspective, continuous exposure to pornography increases the risk of depression, anxiety, and lowers self-esteem and satisfaction in interpersonal relationships. From an Islamic perspective, the majority of scholars consider pornography to be a prohibited behavior (haram) because it contradicts the principles of morality and self-purity. Pornography is seen as damaging a person's morals and spirituality, as well as disrupting the harmony of social relationships, especially in the context of marriage. Although there is a moderate view that acknowledges that the effects of pornography can vary, the majority of Islamic views agree that pornography consumption has more detrimental effects than benefits. Thus, from both a health and Islamic perspective, pornography is considered harmful to mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being, and should be avoided in order to maintain morality and brain health.

Understanding Associations between Personal Definitions of Pornography, Using Pornography, and Depression

Number of 

Key takeaways:Personal definitions of pornography influence usage patterns and depression, with viewing sexual material not considered pornographic being linked to higher depressive symptoms.

Abstract:Pornography has received increased scholarly and policy attention, as the rate of online pornography consumption has increased and the availability of sexually explicit material grows. However, few studies have taken into consideration how personal definitions of what sexual material is perceived as pornographic may influence the correlates and outcomes associated with such consumption. Using a sample of 1639 individuals sampled online from the MTurk website, we explored how definitions of sexual material as pornographic are related to actual use and how differences between the perceptions of sexual material as pornography and use of such material were associated with depressive symptoms. Results suggested that the perception of sexual material as pornographic was significantly related to usage patterns and that this pattern varied based on how explicit the material was. Results also suggested that individual differences between perception and use were significantly related to depression. Specifically, viewing sexual material one does not deem as pornographic was related to higher levels of depressive symptoms. However, global acceptance of pornography and the general perception of sexual content as pornographic or not did not moderate associations between pornography use and depressive symptoms. Implications for future research and for the further understanding of the effects of pornography use are discussed.

The objective of the present study is to understand and explain how pornography addiction and dating anxiety affected people's mental health and their well-beings. According to the objective of the present study, the total number of 116 participants were selected with under the age group of 18-27 which including both male and female.

Impact Of Pornography On Executive Functioning, Depression And Aggression

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography consumption may interfere with working memory performance in adolescents and young adults, potentially reinforcing sexist attitudes and abusive behaviors.

Abstract:The widespread accessibility and consumption of internet pornography have raised concerns regarding its potential impact on cognitive functioning, sexual attitudes, and behaviors. This study investigates the influence of pornography consumption on working memory (WM) performance among adolescents and young adults. Drawing on neuroimaging evidence indicating heightened activations in emotion-related brain regions during the processing of sexual stimuli, as well as sparse research suggesting attention-capturing effects of pornographic content, the study hypothesizes that exposure to pornographic stimuli may interfere with WM capabilities, particularly due to the arousal elicited by sexual content. The study examines the broader societal implications of pornography consumption, including its portrayal of male sexual dominance and its potential reinforcement of sexist attitudes and abusive behaviors. While some argue that pornography serves as a means of sexual exploration and satisfaction, others contend that it promotes unrealistic body images and sexual behaviors, challenges traditional values of monogamy and fidelity, and contributes to the development of risky sexual behaviors. By investigating the cognitive and socio-cultural impacts of pornography consumption, this study aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding its usage. Findings from this research have the potential to inform educational programs, interventions, and policies aimed at promoting healthy sexual attitudes and behaviors among adolescents and young adults in the digital age.

Associations of sexual dysfunction with problematic pornography use and attachment styles: a cross-sectional study of Hungarian-Spanish samples

Number of 

Key takeaways:Attachment styles play a significant role in sexual functioning and problematic pornography use, with secure styles showing the least difficulties and anxious-ambivalent and disorganized styles causing more problems.

Abstract:Introduction In the last decades, growing evidence suggests, that young adults and even adolescents consume more and more pornographic content, which might lead to behavioural addictions. Excessive pornography use was found to be associated with higher rates of sexual dysfunctions, such as genital dysfunction or disorders related to desire, arousal, orgasm and pain. The role of attachment style on sexual function has still rarely been investigated. Objectives To examine associations between sexual dysfunction, problematic pornography use and attachment styles in a Spanish-Hungarian sample. Methods A cross-sectional comparative study was carried out in 2023 which included a Hungarian (N=447; 63% female; age: 30,5±9,8) and a Spanish sample (N=201; 72% female; age: 40,7±14) from the general population. In the online survey, we used the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) to measure sexual dysfunction, the Problematic Pornography Use Scale (PPCS) to assess pornographic content consumption within the theoretical framework of addiction and the Relationships Questionnaire to explore the attachment styles of the subjects. Results 13% of the Hungarian sample and 19% of the Spanish sample reported severe sexual dysfunction (ASEXTotal >19). The Hungarian sample reported more problems related to orgasm (climax and satisfaction). Overall, 7% of the Hungarian sample and 1% of the Spanish sample reported very severe problems (PPCSTotal >76) with pornography use. We found significant differences in every subscale and the Hungarian sample reportedly showed more difficulties in every aspect, especially in salience and mood change. Regarding attachment styles, the samples also showed significant differences (Hungarian: 31% secure, 26% anxious-ambivalent, 20% avoidant, 23% disorganized; Spanish: 53% secure, 11% anxious-ambivalent, 23% avoidant, 13% disorganized). In the combined sample, secure attachment style was associated with the least difficulties in sexual functioning, whereas subjects with anxious-ambivalent style reported more problems in sexual drive, arousal and erection. Disorganized attachment style was associated with the most severe dysfunction in orgasm (climax and satisfaction). The association between problematic pornography use and attachment styles was more consistent. Secure attachment style showed the least of problems, whereas subjects with anxious-ambivalent and disorganized attachment styles reported the most, especially in salience and mood change. Conclusions Our findings showed significant intercultural differences between the two samples and highlighted the potential role of attachment styles in sexual functioning and problematic pornography use. A more profound understanding of the relationship between attachment and sexual functioning could facilitate potential treatment of sexual dysfunctions by addressing attachment issues in psychotherapy.

(181) RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF PORNOGRAPHY ON THE SEXUAL HEALTH OF WOMEN

Number of 

Key takeaways:Consumption of pornography can enhance pleasure and sexual knowledge, but also contributes to sexual dysfunction, violence, and body image dissatisfaction.

Abstract:Access to pornographic content facilitated by advances in technology has contributed to consolidating the viewing of pornography as a common practice in society, considering the interest in issues of sexuality, which is a central aspect of human life. The search for online pornographic content has grown in the young population, especially among female consumers, exerting an influence on sexual practices. Positive and negative points of the consumption of online pornography have been addressed by researchers and there is a consensus that this material has become a new form of sexual education for an entire generation.
 
 
 
 The aim of the present study was to perform a literature review to identify the impact of the consumption of pornography on female sexual health.
 
 
 
 Methods: A descriptive, qualitative study was conducted based on a systematic review of the literature. Searches were conducted in the LILACS, IBECS and Medline databases for relevant articles published in English and Portuguese in the period from 2017 to 2022.
 
 
 
 The search of the databases led to the retrieval of 937 records, three of which were duplicates and were removed. After the analysis of titles and abstracts, 913 articles were excluded and 12 were submitted to full-text analysis, three of which were excluded, leading to a sample of nine articles. The positive points related to the consumption of pornography included the search for sexual knowledge and suggestions for sexual practices, positions and fantasies that assist in the safe search for self-knowledge, consequently favoring the enhancement of pleasure. The negative points were sexual dysfunction, physical and emotional violence, sexual practices requiring a high performance and dissatisfaction with one’s body image. Moreover, unconsented sexual practices, pressure to perform certain acts and the objectification of women are common in pornography and can influence the propagation of these practices in real life by individuals who consume this content available free of charge on online platforms.
 
 
 
 There is a need for further scientific studies and sexual education campaigns to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of pornography, such as issues of self-esteem and those related to violence.

A Meta-Analysis of Pornography Consumption and Actual Acts of Sexual Aggression in General Population Studies

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography consumption is strongly associated with sexual aggression, with stronger associations for verbal than physical aggression, and violent content may exacerbate the issue.

Abstract:Whether pornography consumption is a reliable correlate of sexually aggressive behavior continues to be debated. Meta-analyses of experimental studies have found effects on aggressive behavior and attitudes. That pornography consumption correlates with aggressive attitudes in naturalistic studies has also been found. Yet, no meta-analysis has addressed the question motivating this body of work: Is pornography consumption correlated with committing actual acts of sexual aggression? 22 studies from 7 different countries were analyzed. Consumption was associated with sexual aggression in the United States and internationally, among males and females, and in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Associations were stronger for verbal than physical sexual aggression, although both were significant. The general pattern of results suggested that violent content may be an exacerbating factor.

Pornography and Heterosexual Women's Intimate Experiences with a Partner.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher rates of pornography consumption for masturbation are associated with increased mental activation of the pornographic script during sex, leading to increased insecurities and diminished enjoyment of intimate acts with a partner.

Abstract:Background: Pornographic media characterized by discordant images of sexual pleasure and aggression are increasingly formulating young heterosexual women's sexual scripts. Yet there has been little work done on the downstream role of pornography consumption; how does pornography use relate to heterosexual women's thoughts and feelings during sexual experiences with a partner? Materials and Methods: We surveyed 706 heterosexual women (18-29 years of age) in the United States, associating consumption of pornography with sexual preferences, experiences, and concerns. Results: Although most heterosexual women have seen pornography (83%), a little less than half (43.5%) use it for masturbation, half of whom use it one time per month or less. Among female consumers who were sexually active, higher rates of consumption for masturbation were associated with increased mental activation of the pornographic script during sex-heightened recall of pornographic images during sex with a partner, heightened reliance on pornography for achieving and maintaining arousal, and a preference for pornography consumption over sex with a partner. Furthermore, higher activation of the pornographic script during sex, rather than simply viewing pornographic material, was also associated with higher rates of insecurities about their appearance and diminished enjoyment of intimate acts such as kissing or caressing during sex with a partner. Conclusion: These findings suggest that pornography consumption may relate to female consumers' sexual experiences indirectly and indicate that pornographic thoughts during dyadic sexual encounters may not improve heterosexual women's sexual experiences with a partner.

Pornography Consumption in People of Different Age Groups: an Analysis Based on Gender, Contents, and Consequences

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography consumption is highly prevalent in all age groups, with age and content influencing preferences and the risk of excessive and problematic use.

Abstract:Abstract Introduction Pornography consumption has increased exponentially in recent decades. Most studies conducted so far are focused on adult samples (typically, between 18 and 30 years old), limiting the generalizability of their results. This study aims to create a taxonomy that groups various pornographic contents and thus explore different aspects of its use (e.g., preference for different pornographic content, excessive and problematic use) in people at different life stages. Methods Between 2016 and 2019, 8,040 individuals (71.3% men) between 12 and 85 years old ( M = 33.25, SD = 14.31) completed a battery that explores pathological and non-pathological pornography use. Participants were distributed into five age groups (&lt; 18 years old, between 18–25, 26–40, 41–60, and &gt; 60) to perform the different analyses (ANOVA and chi-square tests for the differences between the groups, EFA for the analyses of categories of pornographic content, and hierarchical linear regressions to identify the factors related to problematic use). Results Pornography use was highly prevalent (&gt; 85%) in all age groups. Using a data-driven approach, we found that the pornographic content explored in this research can be classified within four categories. Using this taxonomy, we found differences according to the age for most of the pornographic content explored (e.g., sexual intercourse with opposite-sex partners ). Finally, we found that age conditions the way in which preference for different pornographic content increases the risk of excessive and problematic use. Conclusions Pornography consumption is frequent in different age groups, although it varies depending on age and content. In addition, some particular pornographic contents were identified that increase the risk of developing an addiction in different developmental stages. Policy Implications This study provides a preliminary foundation for identifying the unique characteristics of pornography use in different age groups as well as content related to increased problematic use.

The Potential Cutaneous Effects of Pornography Addiction: A Narrative Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography addiction may lead to psychosocial impacts and behavioral changes, but the potential for direct skin injuries and behavioral changes remains unclear.

Abstract:Pornography addiction is an area of increasing concern, particularly due to the ubiquitous nature of pornographic material on the Internet. Even so, there is no formal Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) inclusion of compulsive pornography use as a behavioral addiction. Although the psychosocial impacts of pornography addiction have been studied, the risk of direct skin injuries and behavioral changes brought about by excessive pornography usage remain to be seen. Adult males constitute the majority of cases of engaging in risky and violent sexual behaviors with an unclear association with pornography consumption. Adult females may be likely to copy pubic hair trimming patterns analogous to those seen in pornographic content, even though attitudes towards labiaplasty are unclear. Finally, adolescents regularly exposed to pornography have been found to replicate sexual activity seen in pornographic material and have earlier sexual activity. In the literature evaluated, an association between pornographic material and direct cutaneous disease remains a major area of further research.

Influence Of Pornography Consumption onSexual Desire And Compulsivity In Couples: A Narrative Review.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography consumption is strongly linked to increased sexual desire and compulsivity in couples, highlighting the need for interventions to manage excessive use and improve sexual satisfaction and relationships.

Abstract:Background: This narrative review examines the influence of pornography consumption on sexual desire and compulsivity in couples. Pornography, defined as material consumed for sexual arousal and satisfaction, can pose challenges to relationship stability and potentially contribute to relationship dissolution. Fluctuations in sexual desire can disrupt relationships and impact the sexual health of couples. Compulsive sexual behaviour may lead to repetitive actions that cause significant distress and impair daily functioning. Understanding the impact of pornography consumption on sexual desire and compulsivity is crucial for developing effective interventions that promote healthy relationships and sexual well-being among couples. Methodology: This review analysed studies from 2018 to 2024 Using SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases. Ten Studies were selected based on their empirical examination of the connection between pornography consumption, sexual desire, and compulsivity in couples. Key Findings: Pornography consumption and sexual desire and compulsivity in couples are related . Specifically, pornography use and low relationship intimacy are linked to reduced sexual desire and increased frequency of masturbation in men. Additionally, couples who both consume pornography (shared consumers) report higher sexual desire compared to couples where only one partner engages in pornography use (discordant consumers).violent pornographic content has been identified as a factor that raises the risk of developing compulsive sexual behaviour. The study also suggests that impulsivity and problematic pornography use are associated with sexual compulsivity, where individuals may struggle to control their sexual behaviours, potentially exacerbating issues related to intimacy and sexual satisfaction. Conclusions: The findings show a strong link between pornography consumption and increased sexual desire and compulsivity among couples. This highlights the need for interventions to manage or reduce excessive use, improving sexual satisfaction and relationships.

Pornography, sexual orientation and ambivalent sexism in young adults in Spain

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pornography consumption is linked to sexism, with varying effects on sex and sexual orientation, highlighting the need for affective-sexual education programs for young adults.

Abstract:Background On line platforms offer access to an almost unlimited variety of pornographic material that shows high levels of sexism. Despite this fact, there are still few studies that assess the effect of pornography on sexism in young adults The aim of this study is to analyze the association of pornography consumption and sexual orientation with benevolent sexism (BS) and hostile sexism (HS) in young men and women. Methods We surveyed 2,346 people aged 18–35 years old. Multiple regression models were carried out for BS and HS. The independent variables: current pornography consumption and sexual orientation. Covariates: socio-demographic variables -age, sex, level of education and place of birth-. Results A) HS : Men who consumed pornography had higher median values of HS than those who did not . Homosexual/ bisexual men displayed lower values of HS than heterosexual men . The increase in HS levels associated with pornography consumption was notably greater in homosexual and bisexual women relative to heterosexual women, where that pattern was not observed . B ) BS : Mean values of BS were observed to be lower for both women and men who consumed pornography compared to those who did not. Homosexual/bisexual men recorded mean values of BS lower than heterosexual men . Conclusions Pornography consumption is related to sexism and differs according to sex and sexual orientation. As sexism is the substratum of inequality between men and women, it is urgent to launch affective-sexual education programs for young people that take into account the determinants of sexism.

Key takeaways:Frequent pornography consumption is associated with reduced gray matter volume in the right caudate, altered functional activity in the left putamen, and lower connectivity between the right caudate and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Abstract:IMPORTANCE
Since pornography appeared on the Internet, the accessibility, affordability, and anonymity of consuming visual sexual stimuli have increased and attracted millions of users. Based on the assumption that pornography consumption bears resemblance with reward-seeking behavior, novelty-seeking behavior, and addictive behavior, we hypothesized alterations of the frontostriatal network in frequent users.

OBJECTIVE
To determine whether frequent pornography consumption is associated with the frontostriatal network.

In a study conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany, 64 healthy male adults covering a wide range of pornography consumption reported hours of pornography consumption per week. Pornography consumption was associated with neural structure, task-related activation, and functional resting-state connectivity.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Gray matter volume of the brain was measured by voxel-based morphometry and resting state functional connectivity was measured on 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scans.

RESULTS
We found a significant negative association between reported pornography hours per week and gray matter volume in the right caudate (P < .001, corrected for multiple comparisons) as well as with functional activity during a sexual cue-reactivity paradigm in the left putamen (P < .001). Functional connectivity of the right caudate to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was negatively associated with hours of pornography consumption.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
The negative association of self-reported pornography consumption with the right striatum (caudate) volume, left striatum (putamen) activation during cue reactivity, and lower functional connectivity of the right caudate to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could reflect change in neural plasticity as a consequence of an intense stimulation of the reward system, together with a lower top-down modulation of prefrontal cortical areas. Alternatively, it could be a precondition that makes pornography consumption more rewarding.

The impact of internet pornography addiction on brain function: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Internet pornography addiction leads to hyperactive and inhibited brain areas, affecting reaction times and accuracy in various tasks.

Abstract:Introduction There is extensive awareness of internet pornography addiction. It not only affects the mental health of adolescents but also promotes criminal activity. However, the impact of internet pornography addiction on functional in the brain remains unclear. Methods 16 healthy college students and five college students with severe internet pornography addiction were invited to participate in the experiment and watch a pornographic video. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure the dynamic changes in hemoglobin in the brain during a 10 min session of viewing internet pornography. Participants completed the Stroop Color and Word Task (SCWT) before and after they had watched the video. Facial expressions and life signs were measured continuously during the experiment. Results Compared with the group that frequently viewed pornographic videos, the group with low-frequency pornography viewing exhibited enhanced functional connectivity in the inferior prefrontal cortex and pars triangularis of Broca’s area in the frontal lobe, the primary somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and the pre-motor and supplementary motor cortices. Moreover, the high-frequency pornography-viewing group exhibited hyperactive parasympathetic activity, more pronounced sexual arousal, and stronger functional connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar area. After viewing the pornography, the high-frequency group demonstrated longer reaction times and significantly reduced accuracy while completing the Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) compared to the low-frequency group and also their own performance before and after viewing the pornography. Discussion This study demonstrated the hyperactive and inhibited brain areas under the impact of pornography video addiction. The results may strengthen our understanding of neurobiology and facilitate the development of prevention policies for adolescents.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ONLINE PORN CONSUMPTION

Number of 

Key takeaways:Online pornography consumption can cause brain changes similar to drug use, leading to dysregulation of dopamine levels and neuroplasticity in the limbic system, potentially leading to compulsive behavior and depression.

Abstract:There is neuroscientific evidence that pornography consumption affects the human brain in a similar way to drugs, causing in some of its users negative consequences of its uncontrolled use.Objective: To carry out a systematic review in order to investigate the neurological effects of online pornography consumption.Methods: A systematic review of 28 studies was carried out in the PubMed and Virtual Health Library (BVS) databases between May 15th and 29th, 2022.To maximize the uptake of works, the references of the selected literature were also searched.Results and Discussion: The chosen studies involved individuals aged between 18 and 49 years, with sample sizes ranging from 9 to 156 participants.Functional Magnetic Resonance was the most applied neuroimaging technique (n=8).The effects observed in the human brain caused by the frequent consumption of pornography found were a decrease in gray matter, erosion of the prefrontal cortex, and occurring during visual sexual stimulation there was activation of the hypothalamus in men, greater activation of the nucleus accumbens, greater activation of the amygdala and also increased insular activity.Conclusion: The neural effects exerted by the use of pornography consist of the dysregulation of dopamine levels and the neuroplasticity promoted in the limbic system.Such changes can lead to the development of compulsive behavior and depression.

Key takeaways:Addiction to pornography can negatively impact decision-making by medical students at Sebelas Maret University, affecting the brain's pre-frontal cortex and affecting their attitude towards life.

Abstract:Addiction to pornography is the desire to watch or view pornographic content, addiction to pornography has an impact on itself, namely damage to the brain and changes in attitude that can also affect other people and people around pornography addicts. Someone who is addicted will always want to watch porn videos even if they do not watch they will feel anxiety. The purpose of this study is to determine whether pornographic video addiction can affect decision making by students of the medical study program at the Faculty of Medicine, Sebelas Maret University in March 2018,.Does pornography additction affect the brain that regulates part of decision making. Addiction to pornography can damage the five parts of the brain and the most decisive part is the brain’s pre-frotal cortex, which is important for decision making, communication, lust. In addition, the brain is also increasingly difficult to repair hypserstimulation from dopamine.

The Neurosciences of Health Communication: An fNIRS Analysis of Prefrontal Cortex and Porn Consumption in Young Women for the Development of Prevention Health Programs

Number of 

Key takeaways:Viewing pornographic clips activates the prefrontal cortex in young women, with higher self-reported consumption leading to greater activation, suggesting potential applications for prevention programs.

Abstract:This work explores the use of fNIRS neuroimaging technique using young female college students with different levels of consumption of pornography, and the activation of the prefrontal cortex (cue reactivity) when viewing a pornographic clip (cue exposure) versus a control clip. The results indicate that the viewing of the pornographic clip (vs. control clip) causes an activation of Brodmann’s area 45 of the right hemisphere (BA 45, pars triangularis) (p < 0.01). An effect also appears between the level of self-reported consumption and the activation of right BA 45: the higher the level of self-reported consumption, the greater the activation (p < 0.01). On the other hand, those participants who have never consumed pornographic material do not show activity of the right BA 45 compared to the control clip (p < 0.01) indicating a qualitative difference between non-consumers and consumers. These results are consistent with other research made in the field of addictions. It is hypothesized that the mirror neuron system may be involved, through the mechanism of empathy, which could provoke vicarious eroticism. Finally, we suggest the applications that these results may have for primary and secondary prevention programs in the field of problematic consumption of pornography.

Key takeaways:Pornography significantly affects brain volume, memory, and course learning in medical students at Sebelas Maret University in 2018.

Abstract:Addiction to porn videos is the desire that arises to continuously watch porn videos, have dependence on porn videos which will result in sufferers continuously accessing porn videos and feel anxious when not watching porn videos in a short period of time. The purpose of this study was to find out how pornographic videos can affect the memory of medical students at Sebelas Maret University in the class of 2018. The research hypothesis is (a) pornographic videos play a role in changing the memory of eleven medical students at the university in March 2018, (b) pornographic videos brain damage associated with memory, (c) pornographic videos can interfere with the activity of memorizing and understanding lecture learning. The population of this study was the university medical faculty students eleven March 2018. The samples used were 20 students. The sampling technique uses Quota Sampling, where researchers distributed questionnaires to university medical students eleven March 2018 who were participating voluntarily. The measuring instrument used in this study is by distributing questionnaires in the form of g-form, and interviewing addicts. This study also uses a descriptive approach technique by interviewing addicts in four eyes. The results of the study show that pornography greatly affects the shrinking of brain volume, decreased memory and the process of absorbing course learning.

Sexual incentive delay in the scanner: Sexual cue and reward processing, and links to problematic porn consumption and sexual motivation

Number of 

Key takeaways:Reward-related brain areas show increased activity when exposed to pornographic videos and cues, but these activations do not correlate with problematic or pathological pornography use or sexual motivation.

Abstract:Abstract Background and aims The use of pornography, while unproblematic for the majority, can grow into addiction-like behavior which in its extreme form is labeled as compulsive sexual behavioral disorder in the ICD-11 (WHO, 2018). The aim of this study was to investigate the addiction-specific reactivity to cues in order to better understand underlying mechanisms in the development of this disorder. Methods We have used an optimized Sexual Incentive Delay Task to study brain activity in reward associated brain areas during an anticipation phase (with cues predicting pornographic videos, control videos or no videos) and a corresponding delivery phase in healthy men. Correlations to indicators of problematic pornography use, the time spent on pornography use, and trait sexual motivation were analyzed. Results The results of 74 men showed that reward-related brain areas (amygdala, dorsal cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and insula) were significantly more activated by both the pornographic videos and the pornographic cues than by control videos and control cues, respectively. However, we found no relationship between these activations and indicators of problematic pornography use, time spent on pornography use, or with trait sexual motivation. Discussion and conclusions The activity in reward-related brain areas to both visual sexual stimuli as well as cues indicates that optimization of the Sexual Incentive Delay Task was successful. Presumably, associations between reward-related brain activity and indicators for problematic or pathological pornography use might only occur in samples with increased levels and not in a rather healthy sample used in the present study.

A SCOPING REVIEW: THE IMPACT OF PORNOGRAPHY ADDICTION ON ADOLESCENTS

Number of 

Key takeaways:Adolescent pornography addiction negatively impacts psychological, social, and medical development, leading to difficulties establishing interpersonal relationships and decreased cognitive function.

Abstract:The current digitalization process is overgrowing so that internet access becomes more effortless. This has led to an increase in youth exposure to pornography. Prolonged exposure to pornography can negatively impact adolescent development and lead to addiction. This study aims to map the impact of pornography addiction on adolescents using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyze Extensions for Scoping Reviews through Pubmed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Science Direct. The results showed that 14 of the 3,124 research articles that met the inclusion criteria stated that there were 3 effects of pornography addiction: psychological, social, and medical. The psychological impact of excessive consumption of pornography can be in the form of irritability, difficulty concentrating, stress, guilt, frustration, feelings of depression, difficulty sleeping, and psychosomatic symptoms. While the social impact that occurs in pornography addicts is difficulty establishing interpersonal relationships with other people, tend to withdraw, prefer to remain silent, and feel distant from society. As for the medical impact that occurs, based on the results of brain wave recording through electroencephalography (EEG) examination, there is a dominance of delta waves in the prefrontal cortex, which causes a decrease in cognitive function of adolescent porn addicts. This causes adolescents to lose the ability to determine what is right and wrong or refrain from doing wrong. Based on the results of this study, health promotion efforts need to be carried out, one of which is education about the impact of pornography addiction in improving the health status of adolescents.

Neuroscientific Approaches to (Online) Pornography Addiction

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive pornography consumption can be linked to neurobiological mechanisms underlying substance-related addictions, with fMRI studies providing insights into neural correlates of watching pornography and its impact on men.

Abstract:The availability of pornographic material has substantially increased with the development of the Internet. As a result of this, men ask for treatment more often because their pornography consumption intensity is out of control; i.e., they are not able to stop or reduce their problematic behavior although they are faced with negative consequences. There is a long lasting debate whether these kinds of problems should be conceptualized as a behavior addiction. In the last two decades, several studies with neuroscientific approaches, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), were conducted to explore the neural correlates of watching pornography under experimental conditions and the neural correlates of excessive pornography use. Given previous results, excessive pornography consumption can be connected to already known neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development of substance-related addictions. In the introduction, phenomenological, epidemiological, and diagnostic aspects of a syndrome, which is here labeled pornography addiction, will be described knowing that the adequacy of this terminology has to be further validated. In the second section, after aetiological considerations, contemporary neurobiological models will be presented to offer reference points for the question whether excessive pornography consumption can result in an addiction. In the third section of the chapter, neurobiological findings concerning three topics will be summarized: Neural correlates of watching pornography, cue reactivity and appetitive conditioning, and finally neurobiological characteristics of men with pornography addiction. The present contribution will be rounded off with a short conclusion highlighting possible future research questions.

Getting stuck with pornography? Overuse or neglect of cybersex cues in a multitasking situation is related to symptoms of cybersex addiction

Number of 

Key takeaways:Reduced executive control over multitasking performance when confronted with pornographic material may contribute to dysfunctional behaviors and negative consequences of cybersex addiction.

Abstract:Background and aims Some individuals consume cybersex contents, such as pornographic material, in an addictive manner, which leads to severe negative consequences in private life or work. One mechanism leading to negative consequences may be reduced executive control over cognition and behavior that may be necessary to realize goal-oriented switching between cybersex use and other tasks and obligations of life. Methods To address this aspect, we investigated 104 male participants with an executive multitasking paradigm with two sets: One set consisted of pictures of persons, the other set consisted of pornographic pictures. In both sets the pictures had to be classified according to certain criteria. The explicit goal was to work on all classification tasks to equal amounts, by switching between the sets and classification tasks in a balanced manner. Results We found that less balanced performance in this multitasking paradigm was associated with a higher tendency towards cybersex addiction. Persons with this tendency often either overused or neglected working on the pornographic pictures. Discussion The results indicate that reduced executive control over multitasking performance, when being confronted with pornographic material, may contribute to dysfunctional behaviors and negative consequences resulting from cybersex addiction. However, individuals with tendencies towards cybersex addiction seem to have either an inclination to avoid or to approach the pornographic material, as discussed in motivational models of addiction.
