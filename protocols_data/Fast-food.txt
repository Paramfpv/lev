A Key Risk Factor for Metabolic and Cardiovascular Health

Regular consumption of fast food is one of the main factors promoting the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. Fast foods are characterized by high caloric content, large amounts of saturated and trans fats, salt, and sugars, which quickly lead to deterioration of health parameters, especially in individuals with predispositions or lack of physical activity.

Level of evidence:Strong

Fast foods affect the body primarily through excessive supply of calories, saturated and trans fats, and salt, leading to the development of insulin resistance, lipid disorders, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Consumption of these products increases body weight, LDL, and triglyceride levels, and decreases HDL, contributing to atherosclerosis, hypertension, and other metabolic disorders. Negative changes occur after both single and regular consumption, and these effects are amplified by lack of physical activity and other unhealthy eating habits.

The harmfulness of regular fast food consumption has been repeatedly confirmed in epidemiological studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Fast foods lead to a range of serious health consequences, especially in the context of lifestyle diseases and shortened lifespan.

The scale of the fast food consumption problem is steadily increasing worldwide. Epidemiological data indicate a significant contribution of fast food to the global epidemic of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

Plan your meals ahead

Preparing meals at home and planning your menu for several days ahead helps reduce the temptation for spontaneous fast food choices.

Avoid hunger during the day

Try not to leave the house hungry and keep healthy snacks on hand to avoid sudden hunger attacks resulting in a fast food visit.

Find healthier alternatives

Choose restaurants that offer nutritious meals, or swap typical fast foods for their homemade, healthier versions.

Pay attention to ingredients

Read labels and avoid products rich in trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, large amounts of salt, and artificial additives.

If you can't completely eliminate fast food, limit consumption to special occasions and ensure that 80% of your diet consists of unprocessed, high-nutrient foods.

Cardiovascular system

Fast food consumption negatively affects the cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of obesity, metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. The more frequently fast food is consumed, the greater the risk of developing serious cardiovascular diseases.

Final comment:The impact of fast food consumption on health has been repeatedly confirmed in numerous meta-analyses, systematic reviews, cohort studies, and randomized intervention trials involving children, adolescents, and adults. The scientific evidence is exceptionally consistent, covering various populations and demonstrating both biochemical mechanisms (e.g., effects on lipid profile, insulin resistance, induction of inflammation) and long-term health consequences (obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart disease). Moreover, the consensus of scientific organizations and medical societies unequivocally indicates a strong, negative impact of this intervention. No studies suggest health benefits from regular fast food consumption, and all effects demonstrated in studies are consistent in direction (harmful) to health.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Frequent fast food consumption increases the risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, highlighting the need to address this issue.

Abstract:Background: There are growing concern globally regarding the alarming trend of fast food consumption and its related cardiometabolic outcomes including overweight and obesity. This study aimed to review the current evidences available in relation to adverse effects of fast food pattern on cardiometabolic risk factors. Methods: Relevant articles including epidemiological and clinical studies with appropriate design and good quality were obtained through searches of the Medline, PubMed, Scopus databases and Google scholar with related key words including 'fast foods', 'processed foods', 'obesity', 'overweight', 'insulin resistance', 'diabetes', 'cardiovascular disease', 'metabolic syndrome', 'dyslipidemia' and 'hypertension'. Results: Fast food consumption and out-of-home eating behavior is a main risk factor for lower diet quality, higher calorie and fat intake and lower micronutrients density of diet. Frequent consumption of fast foods was accompanied with overweight and abdominal fat gain, impaired insulin and glucose homeostasis, lipid and lipoprotein disorders, induction of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Higher fast food consumption also increases the risk of developmental diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: This review provides further evidence warning us against the irreparable effects of fast food consumption on public health especially the increasing global burden of obesity and cardiovascular diseases.

Acute effects of various fast-food meals on vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk markers: the Hamburg Burger Trial.

Number of 

Key takeaways:A conventional beef burger meal and presumably healthier alternatives with or without vitamin-rich side orders did not significantly differ in their acute effects on vascular reactivity.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
High-fat meals have negative effects on endothelial function, but vitamin-rich side orders may prevent these negative effects.

OBJECTIVE
The acute effects of conventional and alternative fast-food meals on vascular function and various cardiovascular biomarkers were investigated.

DESIGN
In a crossover study, flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilatation (FMD) and cardiovascular disease risk markers were investigated in 24 healthy volunteers before and 2 and 4 h after 3 fast-food meals: a conventional beef burger with French fries, ketchup, and carbonated lemon-flavored soda (meal 1); a vegetarian burger with French fries, ketchup, and carbonated lemon-flavored soda (meal 2); and a vegetarian burger with salad, fruit, yogurt, and orange juice (meal 3).

RESULTS
FMD decreased after all 3 fast-food meals: the values were 9.7 +/- 2.5%, 7.5 +/- 3.5%, and 6.2 +/- 3.3% for meal 1; 9.2 +/- 3.4%, 7.1 +/- 3.4%, and 6.3 +/- 4.0% for meal 2; and 8.8 +/- 3.3%, 6.2 +/- 4.0%, and 6.8 +/- 4.3% for meal 3 at baseline, 2 h, and 4 h, respectively. There were significant intraindividual differences for time (P < 0.001) but not for type of meal (P = 0.677). A postprandial increase in baseline diameter of the brachial artery was significant for time (P < 0.001) but not for type of meal (P = 0.148).

CONCLUSIONS
Against common expectations, a conventional beef burger meal and presumably healthier alternatives with or without vitamin-rich side orders did not differ significantly in their acute effects on vascular reactivity. The frequently reported postprandial decline in FMD may be attributed in part to a postprandial increase in baseline arterial diameter.

Fast Food and Chronic Disease: Exploring the Link Between Dietary Habits and Public Health Challenges

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regular fast food consumption increases the risk of chronic diseases, with dietary habits influenced by food marketing, policy environments, and socioeconomic factors.

Abstract:Fast food consumption has surged globally, raising critical concerns for public health. This systematic review analyzes the relationship between fast food intake and its metabolic and cardiovascular impacts particularly on obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Evidence from the past two decades shows a consistent link between regular fast food consumption and increased risk of chronic diseases, driven by its high calorie, low nutrient composition and its contribution to inflammation and weight gain. These effects are exacerbated among low income populations and in urban environments. Importantly, this study highlights the influence of food marketing, policy environments, and socioeconomic factors in shaping dietary behaviors. Countries with comprehensive nutrition regulations such as taxation on unhealthy food and advertising restrictions report lower dependence on fast food and improved public health outcomes. Thus, this review emphasizes the urgent need for multi sectoral policy interventions to reduce fast food consumption and its health consequences. The findings contribute to public health discourse by offering evidence based insights for formulating targeted nutritional policies, promoting dietary education, and addressing socioeconomic disparities in access to healthy foods.

Number of 

Key takeaways:The Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) significantly reduces HbA1c, IGF-1, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure levels, but does not significantly affect other cardiovascular risk factors.

Abstract:The Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) has gained significant attention as a potential intervention for reducing cardiovascular risk factors. While studies have investigated its effectiveness, findings have been inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify evidence on the impact of FMD on cardiovascular risk factors. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for eligible Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 

Fast food consumption has a great impact on the aging process — A review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fast food consumption contributes to premature aging by fostering chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and oxidative stress, highlighting the need for public health interventions to promote healthier dietary patterns.

Abstract:This review examines the impact of fast food consumption on health and its role in the development of chronic diseases that accelerate the aging process. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to explore the relationship between fast food intake and the onset of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and obesity, all of which are associated with premature aging. The findings indicate that fast foods high in fat and sugar contribute to chronic inflammation — a phenomenon referred to as “inflammageing”, which damages the vascular system and heightens the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and heart failure. Additionally, metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia disrupt glucose homeostasis, further exacerbating chronic inflammation and promoting accelerated aging. Moreover, fast food consumption is linked to an increased risk of cancer, largely due to the presence of carcinogenic compounds in processed meats and the obesity epidemic, which amplifies aging through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormonal imbalances. Collectively, these factors impair immune function and elevate the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, fast food consumption significantly contributes to premature aging by fostering chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and oxidative stress. Urgent public health interventions are necessary to mitigate these adverse effects and promote healthier dietary patterns, to enhance quality of life and longevity.

The Effect of Fasting on Cardiovascular Diseases: A Systematic Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fasting can lower cardiovascular risk, especially when combined with regular exercise.

Abstract:Among the leading causes of morbidity, disability, and death worldwide are cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Their risk factors usually include a variety of factors associated with cardiometabolic disorders. Many public health organizations prioritize the prevention of CVDs and encourage people to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It has been shown that fasting and a healthy diet can promote weight loss and improve cardiometabolic health in various animal species. We want to know the impact of fasting on CVDs. The topic is examined in this systematic review. We looked through a wide range of online sources, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that looked into the connection between CVDs and fasting. We included human research that has been published in English in peer-reviewed publications in the last five years, and then we screened by the title, abstract, and full-text accessibility. We picked the final 10 articles for quality assessment using Cochrane Collaboration's tool for risk-of-bias assessment of RCTs. The findings suggest that fasting is beneficial in lowering the cardiovascular risk of a population. This result holds for all types of fasting used as an intervention in the clinical trials we reviewed. The result is pronounced when fasting regimens are combined with a regular exercise routine. More comprehensive data will come from larger-scale clinical trials and case-control studies, and a thorough examination of all the potential health impacts of fasting is warranted.

Periodic and Intermittent Fasting in Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting, time-restricted eating, prolonged fasting, and fasting-mimicking diets show promise in reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors, with potential for prevention and treatment.

Abstract:Purpose of ReviewCardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death globally. Nutrition plays a central role in CVD risk by affecting aging, adiposity, glycemia, blood pressure, cholesterol, inflammation, and other risk factors and can affect CVD risk not only based on calorie intake and dietary composition but also the timing and range of meals. This review evaluates the effects of fasting, fasting-mimicking diets, and time-restricted eating on the reduction of CVD risk factors and provides initial data on their potential to serve as CVD prevention and treatment therapies.Recent FindingsIntermittent fasting (IF), time-restricted eating (TRE), prolonged fasting (PF), and fasting-mimicking diets (FMD) show promise in the reduction of CVD risk factors.SummaryResults on IF, TRE, PF, and FMD on CVD risk factors are significant and often independent of weight loss, yet long-term studies on their effect on CVD are still lacking. Coupling periodic and prolonged, or intermittent and more frequent cycles of fasting or fasting-mimicking diets, designed to maximize compliance and minimize side effects, has the potential to play a central role in the prevention and treatment of CVD and metabolic syndrome.

Intermittent fasting for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting may reduce weight compared to ad libitum feeding, but its clinical significance and impact on cardiometabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease remain unclear.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Lifestyle changes are at the forefront of preventing the disease. This includes advice such as increasing physical activity and having a healthy balanced diet to reduce risk factors. Intermittent fasting (IF) is a popular dietary plan involving restricting caloric intake to certain days in the week such as alternate day fasting and periodic fasting, and restricting intake to a number of hours in a given day, otherwise known as time-restricted feeding. IF is being researched for its benefits and many randomised controlled trials have looked at its benefits in preventing CVD.

OBJECTIVES
To determine the role of IF in preventing and reducing the risk of CVD in people with or without prior documented CVD.

SEARCH METHODS
We conducted our search on 12 December 2019; we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched three trials registers and searched the reference lists of included papers. Systematic reviews were also viewed for additional studies. There was no language restriction applied.

SELECTION CRITERIA
We included randomised controlled trials comparing IF to ad libitum feeding (eating at any time with no specific caloric restriction) or continuous energy restriction (CER). Participants had to be over the age of 18 and included those with and without cardiometabolic risk factors. Intermittent fasting was categorised into alternate-day fasting, modified alternate-day fasting, periodic fasting and time-restricted feeding.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Five review 

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Intermittent fasting was seen to be superior to ad libitum feeding in reducing weight. However, this was not clinically significant. There was no significant clinical difference between IF and CER in improving cardiometabolic risk factors to reduce the risk of CVD. Further research is needed to understand the safety and risk-benefit analysis of IF in specific patient groups (e.g. patients with diabetes or eating disorders) as well as the effect on longer-term outcomes such as all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction.

Dietary Effects of Fasting on the Lipid Panel

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting improves cardiovascular health, weight loss, and hypertension, but its effect on cholesterol and triglyceride levels is unclear.

Abstract:Introduction Dietary habits, such as the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), have been shown to improve cardiac health. Another more recent popular form of dieting incorporates periods of fasting known as intermittent fasting. The two main forms are alternate-day fasting and time-restricted eating. Methods PubMed search and literature review was undertaken. This review evaluates the current literature regarding the effects of the fasting dietary model and other types of fasting upon the lipid panel. Results There have been studies that have shown that intermittent fasting does provide a benefit in cardiovascular health, weight loss, and hypertension. However, the effect on cholesterol and triglyceride levels during intermittent fasting is in question. Conclusion The effect that fasting has on one’s lipid panel is unclear, there are studies that show that different forms of fasting affect the lipid panel in various ways. There are studies that show that intermittent fasting does improve one’s lipid profile and provides health benefits. Randomized controlled clinical trials with a large sample size are needed to evaluate the effects that intermittent fasting has based on race, ethnicity, gender, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetic and healthy patients, and will lead to definitive evidence of lipid panel outcomes beyond current evidence based solely upon observational cohorts with numerous and multifactorial confounding factors and biases.

Key takeaways:Time-restricted fasting (TRF) can effectively reduce total body weight and fat mass while maintaining lean mass, potentially improving cardiometabolic function.

Abstract:Abstract Background Cardiovascular disease continues to be a leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the need to explore innovative approaches to improve cardiovascular health outcomes. Time-restricted fasting (TRF) is a dietary intervention that involves limiting the time window for food consumption. It has gained attention for its potential benefits on metabolic health and weight management. This study aims to investigate the impact of TRF on key risk factors, including body weight, glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and lipid profile. Methods We conducted a systematic search in five databases (Scopus, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science) for relevant studies up to January 2023. After applying inclusion criteria, 12 studies were eligible for analysis. Quality assessment was conducted using the ROB-2.0 tool and ROBINS-I. Risk of bias was mapped using Revman 5.3, and data analysis included Hartung-Knapp adjustment using R 4.2.2. Results The group that underwent the TRF intervention exhibited a significant decrease in body weight (SMD: -0.22; 95%CI: -0.41, -0.04; P &lt; 0.05) and fat mass (SMD: -0.19; 95%CI: -0.36, -0.02; P &lt; 0.05), while maintaining lean mass (SMD: -0.09; 95%CI: -0.08, 0.26; P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion TRF has shown potential as a treatment strategy for reducing total body weight by targeting adipose tissue, with potential improvements in cardiometabolic function.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fasting can improve cardiovascular health in people at risk or with cardiovascular disease by reducing risk factors and maintaining weight, blood pressure, LDL, and triglyceride levels within normal limits.

Abstract:Introduction: Fasting is defined as the voluntary abstinence from eating for variable time intervals and it has been associated with potential beneficial impacts on human health. The study was to review the benefits of fasting on cardiovascular health in humans with or without cardiovascular disease. Methods: The databases search was done using the keywords ‘fasting’ and ‘cardiovascular system’ using Scopus, Science Direct and ProQuest, limited to between 2013 and 2019 for publication year. A total of 3.619 articles were obtained and 15 articles involving experimental and non-experimental studies were used as the reference material. Results: The findings showed that in people who are healthy, fasting can reduce the inflammatory markers (IL-1 & IL-6, TNF-α), the oxidative stress marker (Malondialdehyde), body weight, abdominal circumference, fasting blood glucose, LDL, triglyceride and blood pressure. In people at risk or with cardiovascular disease, fasting can reduce body weight, body mass index, abdominal circumference, fat percentage, blood pressure, triglyceride, the biomarker of inflammation (serum amyloid A), the biomarker of oxidative stress (protein carbonyl), the biomarker of endothelial dysfunction (asymmetric dimethylarginine) and increase the vascular endothelial growth factor. Conclusion: Based on these findings, fasting can improve the health condition of people at risk or with cardiovascular disease by improving the risk factors such as blood pressure, overweight and endothelial dysfunction. In people who are healthy, fasting can be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease by helping to maintain their weight, blood pressure, LDL and triglyceride within the normal limits.

Effects of long-term fasting and confinement on the cardiovascular activity

Number of 

Key takeaways:Long-term fasting in confined environments can negatively impact cardiovascular health by altering autonomic regulation, reducing serum sodium, increasing calcium, prolonging QTc intervals, and reducing systolic blood pressures.

Abstract:Fasting has been demonstrated to improve health and slow aging in human and other species; however, its impact on the human body in the confined environment is still unclear. This work studies the effects of long-term fasting and confined environment on the cardiovascular activities of human via a 10-day fasting experiment with two groups of subjects being in confined (6 subjects) and unconfined (7 subjects) environments respectively and undergoing the same four-stage fasting/feeding process. It is found that the confinement has significant influences on the autonomic regulation to the heart rate during the fasting process by altering the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is manifested by the significant higher pNN50, rMSSD, and Ln-HF of heart rate variability (HRV) (p < 0.05) and slower heart rate (p < 0.01) in the confined group than that in the unconfined group. Furthermore, the long-term fasting induces a series of changes in both groups, including reduced level of serum sodium (p < 0.01), increased the serum calcium (p < 0.05), prolonged QTc intervals (p < 0.05), and reduced systolic blood pressures (p < 0.05). These effects are potentially negative to human health and therefore need to be treated with caution.Graphical abstractStudy of the effects of fasting and confinement on the cardiovascular activities

Key takeaways:Fast food negatively impacts college-going students' health, leading to heart problems, obesity, fat, sugar, and blood pressure.

Abstract:Introduction: Fast food is a major part of our present life, due to some factors such as the style of life, value and the huge commercial advertisements, it has several effects on human health. Objectives: The basic purpose of this study was to identify the effects of fast food on the health of college-going students. Material and methods: Mixed method research is used for data collection. For qualitative data, 4 key informant interviews were conducted. For quantitative data, a descriptive research design was used and random sampling techniques were selected for sample size. The sample size consisted of 107 respondents. A guideline questionnaire was used for key informants as well as a well-structured questionnaire was used for the purpose of data collection. For analysis of qualitative data thematic analysis was used. Statistical packages for social sciences (SPSS) were used for quantitative data analysis. Results: The main effects of fast food on the health of college-going students like heart problems, obesity, fat, sugar and blood pressure. Majorities (91.6%) of the respondents have information about fast food and (8.4%) did not have any information about fast food disease. A majority (77.6%) of the respondents have information about the controlled use of fast food and 22.4% did not know it. Conclusion: Mass media should spread awareness among students about the side effects of fast food. So, it is a dire need of time to create awareness among the society at youngsters’ level and nutrition programs should be studied as well as the role of mass media should be changed for creating awareness regarding the effects of fast food.

Associations of Dietary Intake with Cardiovascular Risk in Long-Term “Plant-Based Eaters”: A Secondary Analysis of a Cross-Sectional Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:A long-term plant-based diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and legumes can improve cardiovascular health, while plant-based fast food and pasta may increase uric acid levels.

Abstract:A plant-based diet rich in whole foods and fiber is beneficial for cardiovascular (CV) health. This impact is often linked to specific food groups and their preparation methods, reflecting the overall dietary pattern. However, research on the long-term effects of a carefully designed plant-based diet on adults transitioning from a typical Western lifestyle is limited. Notably, studies on people managing CV risk factors effectively are scarce. As part of a cross-sectional study, we examined 151 individuals committed to a long-term, well-designed plant-based diet and active lifestyle. We investigated how specific food groups and macronutrient intake are related to various CV health markers. In this secondary analysis, our comprehensive approach encompassed several methods: 3-day weighted dietary records, fasting blood lipid and blood pressure measurements, body composition assessments, and evaluations of lifestyle status. We adjusted our analysis for multiple variables, such as age, sex, current body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, and time (years) following the plant-based diet. Our findings revealed several associations between macronutrient intake (per 50 g) and CV risk markers, although these associations were generally weak. Individuals who consumed more whole grains and fruits had lower levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) cholesterol. We also found associations between the intake of legumes and nuts/seeds and reduced HDL-C levels. These findings suggested that these food groups might influence the lipid profile, contributing to CV health in a plant-based diet. A greater intake of spices/herbs was associated with lower uric acid levels, while diets rich in plant-based fast food and pasta (made from white flour) were associated with higher uric acid levels. A greater intake of various macronutrients, such as fiber, carbohydrates (from whole-food sources), proteins, and different types of fats (saturated fatty acids , monounsaturated fatty acids , and polyunsaturated fatty acids ), was associated with lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C (only for carbohydrates), and HDL-C. We found a unique negative correlation between PUFA intake and LDL-C, suggesting that PUFAs might significantly affect LDL-C levels. In contrast, increased fiber, protein and SFA consumption were associated with increased uric acid levels. These findings support the impact of dietary patterns on CV risk factors, highlighting that even small amounts of unhealthy food groups can significantly influence specific CV risk markers, regardless of the overall diet.

Fast Food Intake Increases the Incidence of Metabolic Syndrome in Children and Adolescents: Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fast food consumption is associated with an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, abdominal obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia in Tehranian children and adolescents.

Abstract:The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between fast food consumption and incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components among children and adolescents over a 3.6 year follow-up. Dietary data of 424 healthy subjects, aged 6–18 years, was collected using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Cook et al criteria. Consumption of fast foods including hamburgers, sausages, bologna (beef), and fried potatoes was calculated and further categorized to quartiles. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the incidence of MetS and its components in each quartile of fast food intake. The incidence of MetS was 11.3% after a 3.6 year follow up. In the fully adjusted model, compared to the lowest quartile of fast food intake, individuals in the highest had odds ratios of 2.96 (95% CI: 1.02–8.63; P for trend<0.001), 2.82 (95% CI: 1.01–7.87; P for trend = 0.037), and 2.58 (95% CI: 1.01–6.61; P for trend = 0.009) for incidence of MetS, hypertriglyceridemia, and abdominal obesity, respectively. No significant association was found between fast food intakes and other components of MetS. Fast food consumption is associated with the incidence of MetS, abdominal obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia in Tehranian children and adolescents.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regular fast food consumption is associated with higher weight, insulin resistance, waist circumference, and triglyceride levels, and lower HDL cholesterol levels in young adults.

Abstract:Although away-from-home eating is adversely associated with weight, other comorbidities have not been examined; therefore, we sought to determine the associations of fast food (e.g. Wendy's, McDonalds) and restaurant (sit-down style) consumption (times per week) with weight and multiple metabolic outcomes, including homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), waist circumference, and plasma triglycerides (TG), LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). We used 3 waves of data (exam y 7, 10, and 20) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, a prospective cohort study of black and white young adults . Individuals in the highest (vs. lowest) quartile of baseline (defined as the mean of y 7 and 10) fast food consumption had higher y 20 weight , HOMA-IR , waist circumference , TG concentrations , and lower HDL-C concentrations . Baseline restaurant consumption was unrelated to y 20 outcomes. Adjusted change in weekly restaurant (P < 0.05) and fast food intake (P < 0.001) was associated with 13-y changes in body weight and waist circumference . Fast food consumption may be an important target for the prevention of adverse metabolic health outcomes.

Fast food, central nervous system insulin resistance, and obesity.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fast food consumption contributes to obesity by affecting energy metabolism and central nervous system insulin resistance, leading to leptin resistance and promoting pleasurable food responses.

Abstract:Rates of obesity and insulin resistance have climbed sharply over the past 30 years. These epidemics are temporally related to a dramatic rise in consumption of fast food; until recently, it was not known whether the fast food was driving the obesity, or vice versa. We review the unique properties of fast food that make it the ideal obesigenic foodstuff, and elucidate the mechanisms by which fast food intake contributes to obesity, emphasizing its effects on energy metabolism and on the central regulation of appetite. After examining the epidemiology of fast food consumption, obesity, and insulin resistance, we review insulin's role in the central nervous system's (CNS) regulation of energy balance, and demonstrate the role of CNS insulin resistance as a cause of leptin resistance and in the promotion of the pleasurable or 'hedonic' responses to food. Finally, we analyze the characteristics of fast food, including high-energy density, high fat, high fructose, low fiber, and low dairy intake, which favor the development of CNS insulin resistance and obesity.

Fast foods, energy density and obesity: a possible mechanistic link

Number of 

Key takeaways:High energy densities of fast foods challenge human appetite control systems, leading to accidental consumption of excess energy and potentially promoting weight gain and obesity.

Abstract:Fast foods are frequently linked to the epidemic of obesity, but there has been very little scientific appraisal of a possible causal role. Here we review a series of studies demonstrating that the energy density of foods is a key determinant of energy intake. These studies show that humans have a weak innate ability to recognise foods with a high energy density and to appropriately down‐regulate the bulk of food eaten in order to maintain energy balance. This induces so called ‘passive over‐consumption’. Composition data from leading fast food company websites are then used to illustrate that most fast foods have an extremely high energy density. At some typical outlets the average energy density of the entire menus is ∼1100 kJ 100 g–1. This is 65% higher than the average British diet (∼670 kJ 100 g–1) and more than twice the energy density of recommended healthy diets (∼525 kJ 100 g–1). It is 145% higher than traditional African diets (∼450 kJ 100 g–1) that probably represent the levels against which human weight regulatory mechanisms have evolved. We conclude that the high energy densities of many fast foods challenge human appetite control systems with conditions for which they were never designed. Among regular consumers they are likely to result in the accidental consumption of excess energy and hence to promote weight gain and obesity.

The Global Epidemic of the Metabolic Syndrome

Number of 

Key takeaways:Metabolic syndrome, caused by high calorie-low fiber fast food and decreased physical activity, has become a global health issue, with potential for global solutions through better urban planning, whole grain consumption, and promoting healthy lifestyles.

Abstract:Metabolic syndrome, variously known also as syndrome X, insulin resistance, etc., is defined by WHO as a pathologic condition characterized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Though there is some variation in the definition by other health care organization, the differences are minor. With the successful conquest of communicable infectious diseases in most of the world, this new non-communicable disease (NCD) has become the major health hazard of modern world. Though it started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts. The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities. The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities. The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions. The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it. There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments. For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of unhealthy food, etc. Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be considered.

Intermittent Fasting and Metabolic Health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting can lead to weight loss and improved metabolic health, making it a potential option for individuals experiencing unhealthy weight gain through standard eating patterns.

Abstract:Given the ongoing strain that the obesity epidemic has placed on public health outcomes, new and effective approaches to weight control are needed. One approach to improving weight and metabolic outcomes is intermittent fasting, which consists of multiple different timing schedules for temporary food avoidance, including alternate-day fasting, other similar full-day fasting patterns, and time-restricted feeding (where the day’s food is consumed over a 6-h period, allowing for 18 h of fasting). These feeding schedules have favorable metabolic effects by intermittently inducing the metabolism of fatty acids to ketones. The regimens overall lead to a decrease in weight and have been linked to improvements in dyslipidemia and blood pressure. While more research is needed on longer-term outcomes and this approach should be avoided in particular health conditions, intermittent fasting should be considered as an option for individuals who have a pattern of unhealthy weight gain using standard eating patterns.

Can Fasting Curb the Metabolic Syndrome Epidemic?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding show potential in improving gut microbiota, glucose and insulin metabolism, weight, and lipid metabolism, but more randomized control trials are needed to confirm their suitability for patients with metabolic syndrome.

Abstract:Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that includes hypertension, central obesity, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. Due to the high prevalence (around 1/3 of the world population) economic burden of MetS, there is a need for new dietary, lifestyle, and therapeutic options. Recently, fasting emerged as a dietary method proposed for controlling metabolic risk factors. Intermittent fasting (IF), or time-restricted feeding (TRF), describes an array of feeding patterns in which calorie intake is restricted to a specific time period. Hence, this review aimed to elucidate the latest data on MetS and explore the viability of simple management options, such as IF and TRF. Preclinical studies have shown how IF/TRF exerts beneficial effects on the gut microbiota, glucose and insulin metabolism, weight and visceral fat, and lipid metabolism. However, the results obtained from human studies are somewhat conflicting, as weight loss was achieved in all studies, whereas in some studies, there was no significant effect on insulin resistance, cholesterol/lipid metabolism, or blood pressure. Nevertheless, as only very few human studies were performed, there is a need for more randomized control trials on larger cohorts of patients with MetS to gather higher-yield evidence to clarify whether IF/TRF are suitable dietary patterns for this population.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting, when no or few calories are consumed for periods of 12 hours to several days, can lead to physiological responses in major organ systems, including the musculoskeletal system, that can improve health.

Abstract:Intermittent fasting (IF) is a term used to describe a variety of eating patterns in which no or few calories are consumed for time periods that can range from 12 hours to several days, on a recurring basis. This review is focused on the physiological responses of major organ systems, including the musculoskeletal system, to the onset of the metabolic switch: the point of negative energy balance at which liver glycogen stores are depleted and fatty acids are mobilized (typically beyond 12 hours after cessation of food intake).

Fasting and metabolic syndrome: A systematic review and Meta-analyses

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fasting significantly reduces body weight, BMI, body fat percent, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR in patients with metabolic syndrome, but has no effect on glucose, blood pressure, or lipids profile.

Abstract:Abstract Objective: Fasting is considered to be a food structure that can improve body health. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have investigated the effects of fasting in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). In this review, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the effects of fasting on patients with MS. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central updated to September 2021. The quality evaluation and heterogeneity detection of the included research literature were carried out by Revman and Stata software through a random-effects model. Results: A total of 268 subjects were included. The pooled results revealed that fasting significantly reduced body weight (WMD: −2.48 kg, 95% CI: −3.22, −1.74), BMI (WMD = −2.72 cm; 95%CI: −4.04, −1.40 cm), body fat percent (WMD: −1.57%, 95%CI: −2.47, −0.68), insulin level (WMD: −2.45 mmol/L; 95%CI: −4.40, −0.49 mmol/L) and HOMA-IR (WMD:-0.65 mmol/L; 95%CI: −0.90, −0.41 mmol/L) in patients with MS, whereas had no effect on glucose, blood pressure and lipids profile. Conclusions: Our findings provide insights into the effect of fasting on the anthropometric outcomes, insulin resistance, and gut microbiota in MS.

Health Benefits of Fasting and Caloric Restriction

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fasting and intermittent calorie restriction have many health benefits, including improved metabolism, reduced diabetes risk, and reduced malnutrition, but behavioral modifications are crucial for maintaining favorable outcomes.

Abstract:Purpose of ReviewObesity and obesity-related diseases, largely resulting from urbanization and behavioral changes, are now of global importance. Energy restriction, though, is associated with health improvements and increased longevity. We review some important mechanisms related to calorie limitation aimed at controlling of metabolic diseases, particularly diabetes.Recent FindingsCalorie restriction triggers a complex series of intricate events, including activation of cellular stress response elements, improved autophagy, modification of apoptosis, and alteration in hormonal balance. Intermittent fasting is not only more acceptable to patients, but it also prevents some of the adverse effects of chronic calorie restriction, especially malnutrition.SummaryThere are many somatic and potentially psychologic benefits of fasting or intermittent calorie restriction. However, some behavioral modifications related to abstinence of binge eating following a fasting period are crucial in maintaining the desired favorable outcomes.

Reduced caloric intake and periodic fasting independently contribute to metabolic effects of caloric restriction

Number of 

Key takeaways:Caloric restriction and periodic fasting both contribute to metabolic benefits, but time-restricted feeding is metabolically different from caloric restriction, potentially impacting longevity.

Abstract:Caloric restriction (CR) has positive effects on health and longevity. CR in mammals implements time‐restricted (TR) feeding, a short period of feeding followed by prolonged fasting. Periodic fasting, in the form of TR or mealtime, improves metabolism without reduction in caloric intake. In order to understand the relative contribution of reduced food intake and periodic fasting to the health benefits of CR, we compared physiological and metabolic changes induced by CR and TR (without reduced food intake) in mice. CR significantly reduced blood glucose and insulin around the clock, improved glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity (IS). TR reduced blood insulin and increased insulin sensitivity, but in contrast to CR, TR did not improve glucose homeostasis. Liver expression of circadian clock genes was affected by both diets while the mRNA expression of glucose metabolism genes was significantly induced by CR, and not by TR, which is in agreement with the minor effect of TR on glucose metabolism. Thus, periodic fasting contributes to some metabolic benefits of CR, but TR is metabolically different from CR. This difference might contribute to differential effects of CR and TR on longevity.

Intermittent Fasting and 'Metabolic Switch': Effects on Metabolic Syndrome, Pre-diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting regimens show similar effectiveness to calorie restriction for weight loss and glycemic improvement in individuals with metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but long-term adherence and sustainability require further study.

Abstract:Various intermittent fasting (IF) dietary plans have gained popularity among obese individuals in recent years as a means of achieving weight loss. Yet, studies evaluating the effect of IF regimens in people with metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are limited. The aim of the present review is to briefly elucidate the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying the positive effects of IF, especially the effect of the proposed 'metabolic switch' on metabolism. Then, we will examine the efficacy and safety of IF regimens in individuals with metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, and T2DM. For this, we performed a MEDLINE PubMed search using the combination of various terminology of IF and included trials in which participants met the additional criteria for either metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes or T2DM. We found four studies in individuals with metabolic syndrome, one study in persons with pre-diabetes, and eight studies in people with T2DM evaluating the effects of different IF regimens. The limited available evidence with small sample sizes and short duration, suggests that IF regimens have similar effectiveness compared to calorie restriction (CR) diets for weight loss and improvement in glycemic parameters. In general, most IF regimens are effective and safe. However, there is increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM who are treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Moreover, the long-term adherence to these regimens appears uncertain. There is a need for large controlled randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of IF regimens especially in individuals with metabolic syndrome and pre-diabetes. If proven to be sustainable and efficacious for prolonged periods, IF could offer a promising approach to improving health at the population level, and would result in multiple public health benefits.

Diet and metabolic syndrome: a narrative review

Number of 

Key takeaways:A Mediterranean diet and DASH diet, with or without calorie restriction, can help prevent and manage metabolic syndrome by increasing fiber, low-glycemic-index foods, fish, dairy, and nuts.

Abstract:Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a highly prevalent condition defined by the presence of at least three out of five risk factors including central obesity, increased fasting glucose, high blood pressure, and dyslipidaemia. Metabolic syndrome is associated with a 2-fold increase in cardiovascular outcomes and a 1.5-fold increase in all-cause mortality. Excess energy intake and Western dietary pattern may influence the development of metabolic syndrome. By contrast, both Mediterranean diet (Med-diet) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, with or without calorie restriction, have positive effects. For the prevention and management of MetS, it is recommended to increase the daily intake of fiber-rich and low-glycaemic-index foods and the consumption of fish and dairy products, especially yogurt and nuts. Moreover, it is advisable to consume a large variety of unprocessed cereals, legumes, and fruit. Finally, it is suggested to replace saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and to limit the consumption of free sugars to less than 10% of the total energy intake. The aim of this narrative review is to analyze current evidence on the different dietary patterns and nutrients that may affect prevention and treatment of MetS and to discuss the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

Effects of intermittent fasting on body composition and clinical health markers in humans.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting effectively reduces body weight, body fat, and improves blood lipids in normal-weight, overweight, and obese humans.

Abstract:Intermittent fasting is a broad term that encompasses a variety of programs that manipulate the timing of eating occasions by utilizing short-term fasts in order to improve body composition and overall health. This review examines studies conducted on intermittent fasting programs to determine if they are effective at improving body composition and clinical health markers associated with disease. Intermittent fasting protocols can be grouped into alternate-day fasting, whole-day fasting, and time-restricted feeding. Alternate-day fasting trials of 3 to 12 weeks in duration appear to be effective at reducing body weight (≈3%-7%), body fat (≈3-5.5 kg), total cholesterol (≈10%-21%), and triglycerides (≈14%-42%) in normal-weight, overweight, and obese humans. Whole-day fasting trials lasting 12 to 24 weeks also reduce body weight (≈3%-9%) and body fat, and favorably improve blood lipids (≈5%-20% reduction in total cholesterol and ≈17%-50% reduction in triglycerides). Research on time-restricted feeding is limited, and clear conclusions cannot be made at present. Future studies should examine long-term effects of intermittent fasting and the potential synergistic effects of combining intermittent fasting with exercise.

Intermittent Fasting: Does It Affect Sports Performance? A Systematic Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Intermittent fasting improves body composition without reducing physical performance, maintaining lean mass, and improving maximum power in athletes.

Abstract:Intermittent fasting is one of the most popular types of diet at the moment because it is an effective nutritional strategy in terms of weight loss. The main objective of this review is to analyze the effects that intermittent fasting has on sports performance. We analyzed physical capacities: aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, strength, and power, as well as their effect on body composition. For this, a bibliographic search was carried out in several databases where 25 research articles were analyzed to clarify these objectives. Inclusion criteria: dates between 2013 and present, free full texts, studies conducted in adult human athletes, English and/or Spanish languages, and if it has been considered that intermittent fasting is mainly linked to sports practice and that this obtains a result in terms of performance or physical capacities. This review was registered in PROSPERO with code ref. 407024, and an evaluation of the quality or risk of bias was performed. After this analysis, results were obtained regarding the improvement of body composition and the maintenance of muscle mass. An influence of intermittent fasting on sports performance and body composition is observed. It can be concluded that intermittent fasting provides benefits in terms of body composition without reducing physical performance, maintenance of lean mass, and improvements in maximum power. But despite this, it is necessary to carry out new studies focusing on the sports field since the samples have been very varied. Additionally, the difference in hours of intermittent fasting should be studied, especially in the case of overnight fasting.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fasting and physical exertion positively influence body satisfaction and health assessment, but do not alter body image parameters in middle-aged men.

Abstract:Background/Objectives: Fasting and physical exertion positively affect body mass and composition. This study aimed to examine the effects of physical changes induced by eight days of water-only fasting and a physical exertion test and their influence on body satisfaction and body image parameters in middle-aged men. Methods: Fifteen participants were assessed for physical (height, body mass, and body composition) and psychological (body satisfaction, evaluation of body parts, and body image determinants) aspects before and after the fasting intervention, both at rest and post-exercise. Correlation and concordance coefficients were calculated for the analyzed variables. Results: It was found that the fasting intervention led to a reduction in body mass and a favorable shift in body composition, while also increasing satisfaction with one’s body and its specific parts. This positively impacted volunteers’ self-assessment of their health status. Selected body image parameters remained at an average level for the male population and did not change following the fasting. Attitudes toward body weight control methods and their perceived effectiveness did not change either. Participants favored reducing food intake and eliminating high-calorie products from their diet, rejecting the use pathological methods typically associated with eating disorders. A few associations between physical and psychological aspects of corporeality were observed, whereas significant correlations between satisfaction with body parts and parameters and a positive body image were confirmed. Conclusions: The above suggest that physical conditions and their changes resulting from fasting and physical exertion lead to a positive influence on body satisfaction and its components but do not alter body image.

Impact of Acute Dietary Manipulations on DXA and BIA Body Composition Estimates

Number of 

Key takeaways:Acute food and fluid intake can artificially influence body composition estimates, with an overnight fast likely being sufficient for DXA and possibly BIA preassessment.

Abstract:Purpose To examine the effects of acute preassessment diets on body composition estimates obtained by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Methods In a counterbalanced design, 48 males and females were provided with two 1-d diets: high-carbohydrate diet (9 g CHO·kg−1) and very low-carbohydrate diet (1 to 1.5 g CHO·kg−1). For each condition, body composition was assessed in the morning after an overnight fast, in the afternoon after feeding, and the following morning after a second overnight fast. Results Acute food ingestion, regardless of macronutrient content, altered DXA and BIA body composition estimates, and both sexes responded similarly. DXA total and regional lean soft tissue estimates increased up to 1.7% and 3% on average in response to feeding, with individual increases of over 4.5% and 9%. DXA total and trunk fat mass estimates decreased by up to 3% on average. All DXA-derived measures of body composition returned to baseline values after the second overnight fast. Impedance measured by BIA decreased by 4.4% in response to feeding, leading to a 2% increase in total body water and fat-free mass, with individual increases up to 4.5%. BIA fat mass estimates decreased 1.4% to 2.4%, with individual decreases of up to 10%. Unlike DXA, most BIA-derived estimates did not return to baseline values after a second overnight fast. Conclusions Acute food and fluid intake can artificially influence body composition estimates, regardless of macronutrient content. An overnight fast is likely sufficient preassessment dietary control for DXA and possibly sufficient for BIA.

The influence of market deregulation on fast food consumption and body mass index: a cross-national time series analysis.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Market deregulation policies may contribute to the obesity epidemic by facilitating the spread of fast food consumption in high-income countries.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effect of fast food consumption on mean population body mass index (BMI) and explore the possible influence of market deregulation on fast food consumption and BMI.

METHODS
The within-country association between fast food consumption and BMI in 25 high-income member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development between 1999 and 2008 was explored through multivariate panel regression models, after adjustment for per capita gross domestic product, urbanization, trade openness, lifestyle indicators and other covariates. The possible mediating effect of annual per capita intake of soft drinks, animal fats and total calories on the association between fast food consumption and BMI was also analysed. Two-stage least squares regression models were conducted, using economic freedom as an instrumental variable, to study the causal effect of fast food consumption on BMI.

FINDINGS
After adjustment for covariates, each 1-unit increase in annual fast food transactions per capita was associated with an increase of 0.033 kg/m2 in age-standardized BMI (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.013-0.052). Only the intake of soft drinksnot animal fat or total caloriesmediated the observed association (β: 0.030; 95% CI: 0.010-0.050). Economic freedom was an independent predictor of fast food consumption (β: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.16-0.37). When economic freedom was used as an instrumental variable, the association between fast food and BMI weakened but remained significant (β: 0.023; 95% CI: 0.001-0.045).

CONCLUSION
Fast food consumption is an independent predictor of mean BMI in high-income countries. Market deregulation policies may contribute to the obesity epidemic by facilitating the spread of fast food.

Impact of daily fasting duration on body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors during a time-restricted eating protocol: a randomized controlled trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:A 16-hour fasting window, even without caloric restriction, may improve body composition in healthy and non-trained individuals, while shorter fasting periods may not produce significant changes.

Abstract:Abstract Background Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary regimen that limits food intake for at least 12 h daily. Unlike other fasting protocols, TRE does not dictate what or how much to eat but rather focuses on the timing of meals. This approach has been previously demonstrated to improve body composition in individuals with obesity or metabolic impairments. However, its impact on body composition and cardiometabolic factors in healthy individuals remains unclear. Furthermore, the optimal fasting duration is still debated. Thus, we aimed to compare the effects of 8 weeks of different fasting durations on body composition and biochemical parameters in metabolically healthy, non-trained individuals using a parallel randomized controlled trial. Methods Forty-one volunteers were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups: TRE 16:8 (16 h of fasting,8 h of eating), TRE 14:10 (14 h of fasting,10 h of eating), TRE 12:12 (12 h of fasting,12 h of eating) or a normal diet group (ND; no dietary restriction). Participants underwent body composition measurements and blood tests for lipid profiles (i.e., total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides), fasting glucose, leptin, and anabolic hormones (i.e., insulin and testosterone) levels. Data were analyzed using both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis to account for compliance. A two-way ANOVA for repeated measures was employed to assess interactions between time and group. Results In the ITT analysis, TRE 16:8 reduced body mass (-2.46%, p = 0.003) and absolute fat mass (-8.65%, p = 0.001) with no changes in lean soft tissue and in calorie intake. These results were consistent with the PP analysis which included 8 participants in TRE 16:8, 5 in TRE 14:10, 9 in TRE 12:12, and the entire ND group. Participants in the TRE 16:8 group spontaneously reduced their total caloric intake, although this reduction was not statistically significant. None of the other measurements significantly changed after 8 weeks. Conclusions Our results suggest that a 16-hour fasting window, even without caloric restriction, may be a viable strategy for improving body composition in healthy and non-trained individuals, whereas a shorter fasting period may be insufficient to produce significant changes in a healthy population.

Effect of Early Time-Restricted Eating on Metabolic Markers and Body Composition in Individuals with Overweight or Obesity

Number of 

Key takeaways:Early time-restricted eating (eTRE) did not show beneficial effects on glycemic and lipid metabolisms, body composition, subjective appetite, or blood pressure in individuals with overweight or obesity.

Abstract:This study aimed to evaluate the effect of early time-restricted eating (eTRE) on metabolic markers and body composition in individuals with overweight or obesity. Seventeen subjects completed a randomized, crossover, and controlled clinical trial. Twelve women and five men participated, with a mean age of 25.8 ± 10.0 years and a BMI of 32.0 ± 6.3 kg/m2. The eTRE intervention included 16 h of fasting (3:00 pm to 7:00 am) and 8 h of ad libitum eating (7:00 am to 03:00 pm) (16:8). The trial included four weeks of interventions followed by a four-week washout period. Body weight, waist and hip circumferences, and body composition measurements were taken. Additionally, a venous blood sample was collected for biochemical determinations. In a before–after analysis, eTRE induced a reduction in BW and BMI in women but this was not significant when compared to the control group. eTRE did not modify any other anthropometric measurements, fasting biochemical parameters, glycemic and insulinemic responses, blood pressure, or subjective appetite. In conclusion, eTRE did not induce beneficial effects on the glycemic and lipid metabolisms, body composition, subjective appetite, or blood pressure. These findings may be attributed to the special characteristics of the population and the short intervention period.

Longer‐term effects of intermittent fasting on body composition and cardiometabolic health in adults with overweight and obesity: A systematic review and meta‐analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Long-term intermittent fasting and continuous caloric restriction are similarly effective for reducing body weight and adiposity, and improving cardiometabolic health markers in adults with overweight or obesity.

Abstract:The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of long‐term intermittent fasting (IF) on body composition and cardiometabolic health in adults with overweight and obesity. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from inception to March 2024 to identify original randomized trials that investigated the effects of IF versus either a control diet (CON) and/or continuous caloric restriction (CR). Participants were adults with overweight and obesity and intervention durations were ≥ 6 months. Overall, a total of 24 studies involving 2032 participants were included in the meta‐analysis. Compared with CON, IF significantly reduced body weight , BMI , fat mass , fat‐free mass , waist circumference , visceral fat , fasting glucose , triglycerides , and diastolic blood pressure . Conversely, IF significantly increased high‐density lipoproteins when compared with CON, but had no effects on insulin, hemoglobin A1c%, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein, or systolic blood pressure. Compared with CR, IF significantly reduced fat mass , body fat percentage , and DBP , and increased HDL , with no other significant effects. Subgroup analyses showed that the mode of IF and intervention duration were the primary moderators of IF effects on the markers. In adults with overweight or obesity, IF and CR are comparably effective for reducing body weight and adiposity, as well as for improving cardiometabolic health markers.

Effect of Ramadan Fasting on Weight and Body Composition in Healthy Non-Athlete Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ramadan fasting leads to temporary reductions in weight and fat mass, particularly in individuals with overweight or obesity, without lifestyle changes.

Abstract:Background: Ramadan involves one month of fasting from sunrise to sunset. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the effect of Ramadan fasting on weight and body composition. Methods: In May 2018, we searched six databases for publications that measured weight and body composition before and after Ramadan, and that did not attempt to influence physical activity or diet. Results: Data were collected from 70 publications (90 comparison groups, 2947 participants). There was a significant positive correlation between starting body mass index and weight lost during the fasting period. Consistently, there was a significant reduction in fat percentage between pre-Ramadan and post-Ramadan in people with overweight or obesity (−1.46 (95% confidence interval: −2.57 to −0.35) %, p = 0.010), but not in those of normal weight (−0.41 (−1.45 to 0.63) %, p = 0.436). Loss of fat-free mass was also significant between pre-Ramadan and post-Ramadan, but was about 30% less than loss of absolute fat mass. At 2–5 weeks after the end of Ramadan, there was a return towards, or to, pre-Ramadan measurements in weight and body composition. Conclusions: Even with no advice on lifestyle changes, there are consistent—albeit transient—reductions in weight and fat mass with the Ramadan fast, especially in people with overweight or obesity.

Human metabolism and body composition: prospects for novel studies.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Alternate-day fasting and time-restricted feeding both influence metabolism and gut microbiota, with differences in their mechanisms and effects on body composition.

Abstract:CONTEXT
Most articles on gut microbiota argue the importance of body composition assessment in patients; however, body composition assessments are fragile (ie, with methodological limitations) in the most recent studies.

OBJECTIVE
To present two suggestions for further research using the human body composition assessment.

METHODS
The methods used in this study are based on a Pinto et al article published in Nutrition Reviews.

DATA EXTRACTION
On the basis of data.
obtained from the PubMed, SCOPUS, LILACS, and Web of Science databases, Pinto et al provided a current survey of intermittent fasting protocols and an understanding of the outcomes to date in terms of the profile of the intestinal microbiota in obese organisms.

DATA ANALYSIS
Of the 82 original articles identified from the databases, 35 were eliminated because of duplication and 32 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Two additional articles found in a new search were added, yielding a total of 17 studies to be included in this review. Among the protocols, alternate-day fasting and time-restricted feeding were the most common, and they were shown to have different mechanisms of metabolic signaling. Time-restricted feeding influences body mass control and biochemical parameters by regulating the circadian system and improving satiety control systems by acting on leptin secretion. In contrast, alternate-day fasting leads to a reduction of ±75% of all energy consumption regardless of dietary composition, in addition to promoting hormonal adjustments that promote body mass control. Furthermore, both protocols could remodel the intestinal microbiota by changing the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and increasing the abundance of strains such as Lactobacillus spp. and Akkermansia that have a protective effect on metabolism against the effects of body mass gain.

CONCLUSION
Changes in adipose tissue (eg, body mass loss, control, gain) should be interpreted via the sum of skinfolds in absolute values, waist perimeter, and patients' body proportionality, because fat is just a fraction of the adipocyte (lipid).

Effects of Ramadan and Non-ramadan Intermittent Fasting on Body Composition: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Non-Ramadan intermittent fasting is more effective in improving overall body composition than Ramadan fasting, with both methods showing beneficial weight management adaptations.

Abstract:Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained popularity for body-composition improvement purposes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the effects of Ramadan vs. non-Ramadan IF on parameters of body composition. We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed articles in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (published until May 2020). Studies were selected if they included samples of adults (≥18 years), had an experimental or observational design, investigated any type of IF and included body composition outcomes. Meta-analytical procedures were conducted when feasible. Sixty-six articles met the eligibility criteria. We found that non-Ramadan IF is effective for decreasing body weight (−0.341 (95% CI , p = 0.006), body mass index (−0.699, 95% CI , p < 0.001), and absolute fat mass (−0.447, 95% CI , p < 0.001). When contrasting pre- post-intervention data on fat-free mass between treatments and controls, group-differences were non-significant (p > 0.05). Conversely, we observed a significant increase in fat-free mass when comparing pre- to post-intervention in a within design fashion (0.306, 95% CI , p = 0.001). Finally, despite being accompanied by dehydration, Ramadan IF is effective in decreasing body weight (−0.353; 95% CI , p = 0.02) and relative fat mass (−0.533; 95% CI , p = 0.034). Ramadan IF seems to implicate some beneficial adaptations in weight management, although non-Ramadan IF appears to be more effective in improving overall body composition.

Key takeaways:Combining exercise training and intermittent fasting leads to superior body composition changes but no additive or synergistic effects on cardiometabolic health markers.

Abstract:Abstract Introduction and aim Exercise training (Ex) and intermittent fasting (IF) are effective for improving body composition and cardiometabolic health overweight and obese adults, but whether combining Ex and IF induces additive or synergistic effects is less well established. We therefore, performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the combined versus independent effects of Ex and IF on body composition and cardiometabolic health in adults. Method An electronic search was conducted in three main online databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, from inception to March 9, 2023 for studies involving Ex plus IF trials versus standalone Ex and/or IF interventions in adults. Interventions had a duration of ≥ 2 weeks. Standardized (SMD) or weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated in order to compare effects on body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat lean body mass (LBM), visceral fat, and waist circumference. For cardiometabolic health, outcomes included fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and VO 2 max/peak. Results Ex plus IF decreased body weight , BMI , body fat , visceral fat , and waist circumference more than Ex alone. However, changes in body composition and cardiometabolic health markers were not significantly different for Ex plus IF when compared with IF alone, with the exception of VO 2 max/peak . Conclusion We demonstrate that a combination of Ex and IF produces superior changes in body composition, but not in markers of cardiometabolic health when compared with Ex or IF alone. Ex plus IF could therefore be effective for weight and fat loss but has no additive or synergistic effects for other cardiometabolic health markers.
