Sedentary Work as a Significant Risk Factor for Chronic Diseases and Health Disorders

Sedentary work, characterized by prolonged sitting, is increasingly common in modern societies. Numerous scientific studies have shown that this work style is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, and musculoskeletal complaints, leading to a deterioration of overall health and quality of life.

Level of evidence:Strong

Prolonged sitting causes negative metabolic and physiological changes, such as impaired vascular function, insulin resistance, and increased inflammation in the body. Sedentary work limits muscle activity, leading to muscle weakness, stiffness, and pain. Additionally, sitting for many hours without breaks negatively affects mental health, increasing the risk of depression and anxiety. Regular breaks for movement and physical activity reduce these negative effects, improving metabolism, blood flow, and well-being.

A sedentary work style has a well-documented negative impact on health, contributing to an increased risk of many chronic diseases and reduced quality of life. Numerous epidemiological studies and meta-analyses confirm its harmfulness to the cardiovascular, mental, and musculoskeletal systems.

The scale of the problem of sedentary work is global, affecting millions of people worldwide, especially in highly developed countries. The rise in office work and technology increases exposure to prolonged sitting, which translates into growing health and social costs.

Take regular breaks from sitting

Every 30-60 minutes, stand up for a few minutes, stretch or walk to reduce the negative effects of sitting.

Change your working position

Use workstations that allow standing or movement, such as height-adjustable desks.

Increase physical activity outside of work

Daily moderate physical activity significantly mitigates the effects of a sedentary work style.

Take care of workplace ergonomics

Adjust your chair, monitor, and keyboard to minimize muscle tension and prevent pain.

Cardiovascular system

Sedentary work negatively affects the cardiovascular system by increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and hypertension. Long hours of sitting lead to metabolic disturbances, inflammation, and impaired vascular function, regardless of physical activity levels outside of work.

Final comment:There is extensive scientific literature, including meta-analyses and numerous observational and interventional studies, confirming that prolonged sitting during work significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, mental health problems, and musculoskeletal disorders. Studies show that the negative effects of sedentary work are not fully compensated by physical activity performed outside of work, and breaks for movement and changes in position bring measurable health benefits. Therefore, sedentary work is considered a significant, independent risk factor for many chronic diseases and reduced quality of life.

Sedentary Behavior and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Mediating Mechanisms

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior may contribute to cardiovascular disease risk by modifying hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic processes, leading to impaired arterial health and contributing to the development of CVD.

Abstract:Sedentary behavior has a strong association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, which may be independent of physical activity. To date, the mechanism(s) that mediate this relationship are poorly understood. We hypothesize that sedentary behavior modifies key hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic processes resulting in impaired arterial health. Subsequently, these vascular impairments directly and indirectly contribute to the development of CVD.

Sedentary Behavior and Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association

Number of 

Key takeaways:Greater time spent in sedentary behavior is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adults.

Abstract:Epidemiological evidence is accumulating that indicates greater time spent in sedentary behavior is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adults such that some countries have disseminated broad guidelines that recommend minimizing sedentary behaviors. Research examining the possible deleterious consequences of excess sedentary behavior is rapidly evolving, with the epidemiology-based literature ahead of potential biological mechanisms that might explain the observed associations. This American Heart Association science advisory reviews the current evidence on sedentary behavior in terms of assessment methods, population prevalence, determinants, associations with cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality, potential underlying mechanisms, and interventions. Recommendations for future research on this emerging cardiovascular health topic are included. Further evidence is required to better inform public health interventions and future quantitative guidelines on sedentary behavior and cardiovascular health outcomes.

Sedentary Behavior, Exercise, and Cardiovascular Health

Key takeaways:Promoting physical activity and exercise training can help prevent chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, by improving cardiorespiratory fitness.

Abstract:Sedentary behavior and physical inactivity are among the leading modifiable risk factors worldwide for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The promotion of physical activity and exercise training (ET) leading to improved levels of cardiorespiratory fitness is needed in all age groups, race, and ethnicities and both sexes to prevent many chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease. In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss the negative impact of sedentary behavior and physical inactivity, as well as the beneficial effects of physical activity /ET and cardiorespiratory fitness for the prevention of chronic noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease. We review the prognostic utility of cardiorespiratory fitness compared with obesity and the metabolic syndrome, as well as the increase of physical activity /ET for patients with heart failure as a therapeutic strategy, and ET dosing. Greater efforts at preventing sedentary behavior and physical inactivity while promoting physical activity, ET, and cardiorespiratory fitness are needed throughout the healthcare system worldwide and particularly in the United States in which the burden of cardiometabolic diseases remains extremely high.

Relationship Between Sedentary Behavior and Cardiovascular Risk

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior is linked to increased risk of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and death, even when individuals meet recommended physical activity goals.

Abstract:The majority of adults do not meet current guideline recommendations for moderate to vigorous physical activity. Recent research has linked a high amount of sedentary behavior with an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and death. This correlation with sedentary behavior even extends to individuals who meet recommended physical activity goals during the remainder of their day, which implies that sedentary behavior may represent a distinct cardiovascular risk factor that is independent of the overall amount of physical activity. During the past several years, there has been significant interest in identifying and understanding the mechanisms through which sedentary behavior affects cardiovascular health. In this review, we critically evaluate the literature pertaining to sedentary behavior and cardiovascular risk with an emphasis on studies published over the past year, and we suggest possible interventions that may help reduce sedentary behavior time.

Impact of Sedentary Behaviors on Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Disease: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behaviors have a negative impact on cardiovascular disease incidence/mortality, with conflicting reports on blood pressure based on study design.

Abstract:BackgroundCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are among the leading causes of mortality in the western world, and high blood pressure is among the greatest risk factors for CVD. Given that most of a person's waking hours are spent in sedentary behaviors, understanding the cardiovascular impact of a sedentary lifestyle is imperative. Although limiting sedentary time is encouraged in public health messaging, individual reviews analyzing its impact on clinically relevant cardiovascular outcomes such as blood pressure and CVD exhibit conflicting results.ObjectiveWe conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses synthesizing the effects of sedentary time/behaviors on blood pressure or CVD.MethodsTo be included, studies had to be a systematic review and/or meta-analysis that studied the impact of sedentary time or a sedentary posture on blood pressure or CVD incidence/mortality. The review was preregistered in PROSPERO (CRD4202342568) and conducted in May 2023. The Joanna Briggs Institute and Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tools assessed study quality. PRISMA reporting was followed.ResultsOur umbrella review screened 2215 citations with 40 review studies meeting our inclusion criteria (n = 22 meta-analyses) that included 234 unique individual studies of 3,769,755 unique participants. The average study quality was high (9.2 ± 1.7 out of 11). A minority of studies (n = 7/20) supported that less sedentary time was associated with lower blood pressure, with reviews of interventional studies typically not observing a consistent effect (n = 9/12), whereas reviews of cross-sectional studies observed a positive effect (n = 5/7). When hypertension rates were used as the outcome, most (n = 3/4) studies observed a deleterious impact of sedentary time. For CVD incidence/mortality, less sedentary time or screen time was consistently associated with a lower CVD incidence/mortality (n = 17/23), with studies exhibiting a null effect generally including small sample sizes and being of a lower study quality. Total sedentary time and specific behaviors (i.e., television and screen time) exhibited similar findings.ConclusionsBased on a high quality of evidence and large sample size, existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate the negative impact of sedentary behaviors on CVD incidence/mortality, with conflicting reports for blood pressure that vary based on the study design.

Effects of sedentary behaviour interventions on biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk in adults: systematic review with meta-analyses

Number of 

Key takeaways:Interventions targeting reductions in sedentary behavior, alone or combined with increased physical activity, show small but significant improvements in some cardiometabolic risk biomarkers in adults.

Abstract:Context/purpose Observational and acute laboratory intervention research has shown that excessive sedentary time is associated adversely with cardiometabolic biomarkers. This systematic review with meta-analyses synthesises results from free living interventions targeting reductions in sedentary behaviour alone or combined with increases in physical activity. Methods Six electronic databases were searched up to August 2019 for sedentary behaviour interventions in adults lasting for ≥7 days publishing cardiometabolic biomarker outcomes covering body anthropometry, blood pressure, glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammation (54 studies). The pooled effectiveness of intervention net of control on 15 biomarker outcomes was evaluated using random effects meta-analyses in the studies with control groups not providing other relevant interventions (33 studies; 6–25 interventions analysed). Results Interventions between 2 weeks and <6 months in non-clinical populations from North America, Europe and Australia comprised much of the evidence base. Pooled effects revealed small, significant (p<0.05) beneficial effects on weight (≈ −0.6 kg), waist circumference (≈ −0.7 cm), percentage body fat (≈ −0.3 %), systolic blood pressure (≈ −1.1 mm Hg), insulin (≈ −1.4 pM) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (≈ 0.04 mM). Pooled effects on the other biomarkers (p>0.05) were also small, and beneficial in direction except for fat-free mass (≈ 0.0 kg). Heterogeneity ranged widely (I2=0.0–72.9). Conclusions Our review of interventions targeting sedentary behaviour reductions alone, or combined with increases in physical activity, found evidence of effectiveness for improving some cardiometabolic risk biomarkers to a small degree. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate inflammation or vascular function. Key limitations to the underlying evidence base include a paucity of high-quality studies, interventions lasting for ≥12 months, sensitive biomarkers and clinical study populations (eg, type 2 diabetes).

Continuous Dose-Response Association Between Sedentary Time and Risk for Cardiovascular Disease: A Meta-analysis.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher sedentary time is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but only at very high levels of sedentary behavior.

Abstract:IMPORTANCE
Prior studies suggest that higher sedentary time is associated with a greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the quantitative, dose-response association between sedentary time and CVD risk is not known.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the categorical and quantitative dose-response association between sedentary time and CVD risk.

DATA SOURCES
Two independent investigators searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for all studies published before July 6, 2015, that evaluated the association between sedentary time and incident CVD.

STUDY SELECTION
Prospective cohort studies with participants 18 years or older that reported the association between sedentary time and incident CVD were included.

DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS
Two independent investigators performed the data extraction and collection using a standardized form. The study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The categorical dose-response association was evaluated by comparing the pooled hazard ratio (HR) for incident CVD associated with different levels of sedentary time (vs lowest sedentary time) across studies. The continuous dose-response association was assessed using random-effects generalized least squares spline models. Data were collected from April 5 to July 6, 2015.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Incident CVD (coronary heart disease, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality).

RESULTS
Nine prospective cohort studies with 720 425 unique participants (57.1% women; 42.9% men; mean age, 54.5 years) and 25 769 unique cardiovascular events and a median follow-up of 11 years were included. In categorical analyses, compared with the lowest sedentary time category (median, 2.5 h/d), participants in the highest sedentary time category (median, 12.5 h/d) had an increased risk for CVD (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19). However, no apparent risk associated with intermediate levels of sedentary time (HR for 7.5 h/d, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.08) was found. In continuous analyses, a nonlinear association between sedentary time and incident CVD was found (P for nonlinearity < .001), with an increased risk observed for more than 10 hours of sedentary time per day (pooled HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.14).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
The association between sedentary time and the risk for CVD is nonlinear with an increased risk only at very high levels. These findings could have implications for guideline recommendations regarding the risks related to sedentary behavior.

Is Sedentary Behavior a Novel Risk Factor for Cardiovascular Disease?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior may increase cardiovascular disease risk, but replacing sedentary time with physical activity can provide cardiometabolic benefits.

Abstract:Purpose of ReviewReview the most recent evidence on the role of sedentary behavior in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).Recent FindingsProspective cohort studies continue to suggest a relationship between sedentary behavior and CVD, but the dose–response association, and the implications of sedentary pattern (vs. total volume) and context on CVD risk require further investigation. Most recent evidence suggests that physical activity influences the association between sedentary time and CVD risk, and that replacing sedentary time with other movement behaviors yields cardiometabolic benefits. Short-term intervention studies have further demonstrated that interrupting prolonged sitting with bouts of physical activity can elicit acute improvements on cardiometabolic biomarkers and vascular function relative to prolonged, uninterrupted sitting, albeit limited evidence exists on the long-term effects.SummaryMore conclusive evidence regarding the implications of sedentary time on CVD risk is warranted before the optimal sedentary behavior reduction prescription for the prevention of CVD can be elucidated.

Sedentary Time and Its Association With Risk for Disease Incidence, Mortality, and Hospitalization in Adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary time is independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases, but the relative hazards are attenuated in individuals who participate in higher levels of physical activity.

Abstract:Adults are advised to accumulate at least 150 minutes of weekly physical activity in bouts of 10 minutes or more (1). The intensity of such habitual physical activity has been found to be a key characteristic of primary and secondary health prevention, with an established preventive role in cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some cancer types (2, 3). Despite the health-enhancing benefits of physical activity, this alone may not be enough to reduce the risk for disease and illness. Population-based studies have found that more than one half of an average person's waking day involves sedentary activities ubiquitously associated with prolonged sitting, such as watching television and using the computer (4). This lifestyle trend is particularly worrisome because studies suggest that long periods of sitting have deleterious health effects independent of adults meeting physical activity guidelines (57). Moreover, physical activity and sedentary behaviors may be mutually exclusive. For example, some persons who achieve their recommended physical activity targets may be highly sedentary throughout the remainder of their waking hours, whereas others who may not regularly participate in physical activity may be nonsedentary because of their leisure activities, workplace environments, or both (8). Although studies and subgroups of systematic reviews have explored the independent association between sedentary behaviors and outcomes after adjustment for physical activity, the magnitude and consistency of such associations and the manner by which they change according to the level of participation in physical activity remain unclear (911). The objective of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively evaluate the association between sedentary time and health outcomes independent of physical activity participation among adult populations. We hypothesized that sedentary time would be independently associated with both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular outcomes after adjusting for participation in physical activity but that the relative hazards associated with sedentary times would be attenuated in those who participate in higher levels of physical activity compared with lower levels (10).

Effects of physical activity and sedentary behaviors on cardiovascular disease and the risk of all-cause mortality in overweight or obese middle-aged and older adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Reducing sedentary time and increasing physical activity may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in overweight or obese middle-aged and older adults.

Abstract:Aim The aim of this study was to respectively explore the relationships between physical activity and sedentary behaviors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality risk in overweight/obese middle-aged and older patients, and also assess the interaction between physical activity and sedentary behaviors. Methods Data of middle-aged and older adults with body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) database in 2007–2018 in this retrospective cohort study. Weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviors and CVDs; weighted univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between physical activity and sedentary behaviors with the risk of all-cause mortality. The interaction effect between physical activity and sedentary behaviors on CVD and all-cause mortality was also assessed. We further explored this interaction effect in subgroups of age and BMI. The evaluation indexes were odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Among 13,699 eligible patients, 1,947 had CVD, and 1,560 died from all-cause mortality. After adjusting for covariates, patients who had high sedentary time seemed to have both high odds of CVD and a high risk of all-cause mortality . Furthermore, being insufficiently active was linked to high odds of CVD as well as a high risk of all-cause mortality . High sedentary time and being insufficiently active had an interaction effect on both high odds of CVD and high risk of all-cause mortality . Individuals of different ages with/without obesity need to focus on the potential CVD/mortality risk of high sedentary time and low physical activity (all P < 0.05). Conclusion Reducing sedentary time combined with increasing physical activity may benefit health by reducing both the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in overweight or obese middle-aged and older adults.

The Physiology of Sedentary Behavior.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior can lead to insulin resistance, vascular dysfunction, reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle loss, and increased fat mass, blood lipid concentrations, and inflammation.

Abstract:Sedentary behaviors (SB) are characterized by a low energy expenditure while in a sitting or reclining posture. Evidence relevant to understanding the physiology of SB can be derived from studies employing several experimental models: bed rest, immobilization, reduced step count, and reducing/interrupting prolonged SB. We examine the relevant physiological evidence relating to body weight and energy balance, intermediary metabolism, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, the musculoskeletal system, the central nervous system, and immunity and inflammatory responses. Excessive and prolonged SB can lead to insulin resistance, vascular dysfunction, shift in substrate use towards carbohydrate oxidation, shift in muscle fiber from oxidative to glycolytic type, reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, loss of muscle mass and strength, and bone mass, and increased total body fat mass and visceral fat depot, blood lipid concentrations, and inflammation. Despite marked differences across individual studies, longer-term interventions aimed at reducing/interrupting SB have resulted in small, albeit marginally clinically meaningful, benefits on body weight, waist circumference, percent body fat, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c and HDL concentrations, systolic blood pressure, and vascular function in adults and older adults. There is more-limited evidence on other health-related outcomes and physiological systems, and for children and adolescents. Future research should focus on the investigation of molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning adaptations to increasing and reducing/ interrupting SB and the necessary changes in SB and physical activity to impact physiological systems and overall health in diverse population groups.

Association between sedentary behavior, physical activity, and cardiovascular disease-related outcomes in adults—A meta-analysis and systematic review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Long-term sedentary behavior increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, while physical activity reduces the risk and improves cardiovascular indicators, but its effect on blood lipids is limited.

Abstract:Background Sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA) are modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, previous research on the effects of PA and SB on CVD has been relatively homogeneous. Our study investigated the association between PA, SB, and CVD-related outcomes. Methods A comprehensive search strategy was conducted in the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from their inception to September 2022. We identified eligible studies according to PICOS: the populations comprised healthy adults, the interventions or exposures were PA or SB, the outcomes were CVD-related outcomes, and the study designs were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal studies (LS). Outcomes were pooled using fixed or random effects models, and the quality of individual studies was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Instrument and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results A total of 148 RCTs and 36 LS were included, comprising a total of 75,075 participants. The study quality was rated as low to moderate. We found an increased hazard ratio (HR) for CVD in the population with SB (HR = 1.34; 95% confidence interval : 1.26 to 1.43; I2 = 52.3%; Pheterogeneity < 0.001, random model) and a decreased HR for CVD in those who performed long-term PA (HR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.77; I2 = 78.0%, Pheterogeneity < 0.001, random model). Long-term PA improved the lipid profiles in healthy adults; participants in this group exhibited increased high-density lipoprotein (weighted mean difference = 2.38; 95% CI: 1.00 to 3.76; I2 = 84.7%; Pheterogeneity < 0.001, random model), decreased triglycerides (WMD = −7.27; 95% CI: −9.68 to −4.87; I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.670, fixed model), and lower total-cholesterol (WMD = −6.84; 95% CI: −9.15 to −4.52; I2 = 38.4%, Pheterogeneity < 0.001, random model). Conclusions Long-term SB increases the risk of CVD in healthy adults, whereas PA reduces the risk of CVD and improves indicators associated with CVD. However, the ability of PA to improve blood lipids appeared to be limited. The detailed association of SB and PA on CVD needs to be further investigated in the future.

Editorial: Sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic health

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior contributes to increased leptin levels and poor cardiovascular health, with high-intensity physical activity potentially benefiting cardiovascular function.

Abstract:Sedentary behaviour is a growing public health issue, with the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) physical activity guidelines now including recommendations regarding sedentary behaviour due to the increasing body of evidence showing the harmful effects of sedentary behaviour on health outcomes (Bull et al., 2020). In an overview of 18 systematic reviews, Saunders et al. 2020 concluded that sedentary behaviour was associated with depression, poor cognitive function and low physicalrelated quality of life. The review of reviews also highlighted that breaking up sedentary behaviour may improve body composition and markers of cardiometabolic risks. It has been reported that Americans spend 55% of their waking time (7.7 hours/day) on sedentary behaviour (Matthews et al., 2008). A more recent epidemiological study in 28 European countries showed an increase in the prevalence of sedentary behaviour (defined by sitting for longer than 4h40 min a day) for both men and women between 2002 and 2017, with a higher prevalence in men (López-Valenciano et al., 2020).Although sedentary behaviour is on the rise, cardiovascular disease and mortality incidence have been declining since 1990, especially in developed countries compared to developing counterparts. This decline is associated with better access to medication and a healthy lifestyle (Amini, Zayeri & Salehi, 2021). However, cardiovascular disease remains the most prevalent non-communicable disease worldwide. It is estimated that CVD causes 17.9 million deaths per year, representing 32% of global deaths (World Health Organization, 2021). This Research Topic contains studies that discuss the prevalence of sedentary behaviour and its potential mechanisms. It also explores the impact of breaking up sedentary time on cardiometabolic markers. Lastly, it examines men's perception of the threat of cardiovascular diseases and the effectiveness of behaviour change.The study by Liang et al., analysed a sample of 5,610 respondents with cardiovascular disease from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In contrast to the study by Lopes-Valenciano(López-Valenciano et al., 2020), which found an increase in prevalence in European countries, Liang et al. found that the prevalence of sedentary behaviour, physical activity levels, and smoking remained stable between 1990-2000 and 2017-2018 in the USA. However, the prevalence of poor diet decreased. Surprisingly, there was a significant increase in obesity, which is difficult to explain considering the reduction in poor diet and maintenance of physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The authors, however, performed a sub-analysis which showed that the group with low education and income were at a higher risk of being exposed to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as sedentary behaviour compared to those at the other end of the spectrum (i.e., high education and income levels), justifying the needs for targeted interventions for this population.Two studies in this Research Topic explored the mechanisms of the association between sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic markers. It is known that high levels of leptin are related to obesity and cardiovascular disease (Katsiki, Mikhailidis & Banach, 2018). In a cross-sectional study, Shih et al. found a positive association between the high leptin group and sedentary behaviour, after adjusting to other behaviours and metabolic markers. The association between sedentary time and leptin levels was observed in individuals with both high BMI and normal BMI, suggesting that BMI was not the sole reason for the increase in leptin levels. The authors suggested that other factors, such as elevated sympathetic tone, may also play a role (Chauntry et al., 2023). The authors concluded that sedentary behaviour independently contributes to increased leptin levels and highlighted the importance of reducing sedentary behaviour to lower leptin levels and prevent cardiovascular diseases.On the other hand, Vandercappellen et. al. investigated the association between sedentary behaviour and physical activity levels with biomarkers of cardiac injury in a large population (The Maastricth study). After controlling for demographic and other lifestyle risk factors, they did not find an association between physical activity, sedentary time, and cardiac troponins, contradicting previous findings from the literature (Aengevaeren et al., 2019). However, they found that vigorous and moderate to vigorous physical activity were associated with lower levels of NT-pro BNP (a biomarker often associated with cardiac stress and heart failure), suggesting that high-intensity physical activity may benefit cardiovascular function.The literature has highlighted the adverse effects of continuous and prolonged sedentary behaviour, which is still a prevalent issue (Chandrasekaran et al., 2021). Silva et al. assessed sedentary behaviour using accelerometers in a sample of 184 adults aged 18-59 years. The authors observed that younger adults spent more time in sedentary bouts (uninterrupted sedentary behaviour) than middle-aged adults. However, time on sedentary breaks (interruption of sedentary bouts with physical activity) was similar. The authors attribute the increase in the use of interactive electronic devices by the younger population as a potential reason for the prolonged time in sedentary bouts. However, while other studies have found an association between cardiovascular markers and sedentary behaviour patterns (English et al., 2018), only age showed a significant correlate in this study. Domoslawska et al. conducted a survey of 1,000 Polish men to assess their perceived susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and the efficacy of preventive behaviours such as physical activity. Despite 54.2% recognising the severity of cardiovascular disease, only 15.1% perceived themselves as being at risk. Most individuals expressed confidence in the effectiveness of preventive measures, including regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and medication adherence. However, the responsive (high threat, high efficacy) and proactive (low threat, high efficacy) groups reported higher engagement in preventive behaviours compared to the indifferent group (low threat, low efficacy). The study concluded that increasing self-efficacy is essential to improving preventive behaviour uptake in men.The articles in this Research Topic offer additional evidence regarding the connection between sedentary behaviour and cardiovascular health. This includes insights into the mechanisms of the association, prevalence and patterns and perceived risks of cardiovascular disease, and the efficacy of modifying preventative behaviours. While more research is needed to guide public health guidelines on the relationship between sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic outcomes, we hope that this issue has contributed to advancing our knowledge in this area.

Independent, Stratified, and Joint Associations of Sedentary Time and Physical Activity With Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary time and physical activity levels are positively and inversely associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes, suggesting that public health messages should encourage both levels of activity.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Recent statistics highlight cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as a major global cause of death. This review examines the methodological approaches and the main results of independent, stratified, and joint association of sedentary time (ST) and physical activity (PA) on CVD outcomes.

METHODS
We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for prospective cohorts that examined the independent, stratified, or joint associations of ST and PA with CVD outcomes. Independent associations were defined as analyses mutually adjusted for PA and ST. Stratified associations were considered when there was a reference group in each stratum of PA or ST, and joint associations were defined by a single reference group for all other combined categories of ST and PA levels.

RESULTS
Of 45 articles, 69% explored independent association of ST or PA on CVD outcomes, while 31% using a stratified/joint approach. Most studies used self-reports for ST and PA and focused on CVD mortality. Mutually adjusted analyses identified ST positively and PA inversely associated to CVD outcomes. Stratified studies showed higher ST's pronounced impact on CVD for lower PA levels. High PA mitigated but did not eliminate ST's negative impact. Joint analyses revealed highest CVD risk in those with both high ST and low PA, and elevated risk in various intermediate combinations.

CONCLUSIONS
Employing independent, stratified, and joint association approaches can yield distinct and complementary public health messages aimed at promoting cardiovascular health. Recommendations should aim to not only to encourage boosting PA levels, but also, concurrently decrease ST.

Sedentary Lifestyle: Overview of Updated Evidence of Potential Health Risks

Key takeaways:Sedentary lifestyles increase health risks such as increased mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer risk, and metabolic disorders, highlighting the need for reducing sedentary behaviors and increasing physical activity for public health benefits.

Abstract:One-third of the global population aged 15 years and older engages in insufficient physical activities, which affects health. However, the health risks posed by sedentary behaviors are not well known. The mean daily duration of sedentary behavior is 8.3 hours among the Korean population and 7.7 hours among the American adult population. Sedentary lifestyles are spreading worldwide because of a lack of available spaces for exercise, increased occupational sedentary behaviors such as office work, and the increased penetration of television and video devices. Consequently, the associated health problems are on the rise. A sedentary lifestyle affects the human body through various mechanisms. Sedentary behaviors reduce lipoprotein lipase activity, muscle glucose, protein transporter activities, impair lipid metabolism, and diminish carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, it decreases cardiac output and systemic blood flow while activating the sympathetic nervous system, ultimately reducing insulin sensitivity and vascular function. It also alters the insulin-like growth factor axis and the circulation levels of sex hormones, which elevates the incidence of hormone-related cancers. Increased sedentary time impairs the gravitostat, the body’s weight homeostat, and weight gain, adiposity, and elevated chronic inflammation caused by sedentary behavior are risk factors for cancer. Sedentary behaviors have wide-ranging adverse impacts on the human body including increased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer risk, and risks of metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; musculoskeletal disorders such as arthralgia and osteoporosis; depression; and, cognitive impairment. Therefore, reducing sedentary behaviors and increasing physical activity are both important to promote public health.

Combined effect of sedentary behavior and physical activity of different intensity on cardiovascular health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Switching from sedentary behavior to moderate-intensity physical activity can have a favorable effect on cardiovascular health.

Abstract:Sedentary behavior (SB) and low (insufficient) physical activity (LPA) are two complementary negative factors affecting cardiovascular health. Most of the current studies are devoted to the study of SB and physical activity (PA) of different intensity separately, while their combined effect has not been studied enough. The purpose was to analyze the literature on the assessment of combined SB+PA effect of different intensity on the general and cardiovascular health of a person. When preparing the review, a search was made for publications in the MedLine, Cochrane, Scopus databases, as well as electronic resources e-library, CyberLeninka and libraries of physical culture and sports universities in Russia for 2002-2022.Issues related to various SB+PA combinations and their effects on general and cardiovascular health are considered and discussed. The facts of the favorable effect of switching sedentary behavior on the same time moderate-intensity PA are presented. The presented data indicate the need for further study, taking into account the mutual substitution of SB and FA of different intensity.

The associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health among adolescents: a systematic review

Sedentary behavior in everyday life relates negatively to mood: An ambulatory assessment study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior in everyday life negatively impacts mood, with more sedentary time leading to less well-being and energized feelings.

Abstract:Empirical evidence shows that physical behavior positively impacts human health. Recently, researchers have started to differentiate between physical activity and sedentary behavior showing independent effects on somatic health. However, whether this differentiation is also relevant for mood dimensions is largely unknown. For investigating the dynamic relationships between sedentary behavior and mood dimensions in daily life, ambulatory assessment (AA) has become the state‐of‐the‐art methodology. To investigate whether sedentary behaviors influence mood dimensions, we conducted an AA study in the everyday life of 92 university employees over 5 days. We continuously measured sedentary behavior via accelerometers and assessed mood repeatedly 10 times each day on smartphone diaries. To optimize our sampling strategy, we used a sophisticated sedentary‐triggered algorithm. We employed multilevel modeling to analyze the within‐subject effects of sedentary behavior on mood. Sedentary time (15‐minute intervals prior to each e‐diary assessment) and sedentary bouts (30‐minute intervals of uninterrupted sedentary behavior) negatively influenced valence and energetic arousal (all Ps < 0.015). In particular, the more participants were sedentary in their everyday life, the less they felt well and energized. Exploratory analyses of the temporal course of these effects supported our findings. Sedentary behavior can be seen as a general risk factor because it impacts both somatic and mental health. Most importantly, physical activity and sedentary behavior showed independent effects on mood dimensions. Accordingly, future studies should consider the two sides of the physical behavior coin: How should physical activity be promoted? and How can sedentary behavior be reduced?

Is leisure sedentary time associated with mental health issues? Evidence from China Health and Nutrition Survey

Number of 

Key takeaways:High levels of leisure sedentary time are associated with adverse mental health issues in Chinese adults, with health literacy and reducing sedentary time being effective in alleviating this adverse impact.

Abstract:Background The relationship between leisure sedentary behaviors and mental health remains inconclusive. This study aims to provide evidence on leisure sedentary behaviors on mental health using longitudinal data, along with its moderating and mediating roles. Methods We utilized data from four waves (2006–2015) of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), focusing on adults who completed their education, with a total sample of 23,693 observations. Leisure sedentary time, the independent variable, was measured based on self-reported data, while mental health issues were the dependent variables based on the Simplified Symptom Self-Rating Scale (SCL) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). The primary analysis employed ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Potential endogeneity was addressed by instrumental variable (IV) method via two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression and a continuous difference-in-differences (DID) design. Results Our findings indicate that high levels of sedentary time are associated adversely with mental health issues. Moderating roles show that improving health literacy and reducing sedentary time were effective in alleviating this adverse impact. Among older adults, social engagement and support from female caregivers showed greater potential to reduce the detrimental mental health impact of leisure sedentary time. Furthermore, obesity serve as its mediating role. Conclusion This study highlights the potential adverse impact of increased leisure sedentary time on mental health among Chinese population. These results provide a foundation for public health initiatives aimed at addressing the rising prevalence of sedentary behavior and its association with mental health issues.

The association between sedentary behaviour and indicators of stress: a systematic review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentariness may be linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety, but current evidence is limited and inconsistent.

Abstract:Abstract Background Emerging evidence shows sedentary behaviour may be associated with mental health outcomes. Yet, the strength of the evidence linking sedentary behaviour and stress is still unclear. This study aimed to synthesise evidence regarding associations between time spent in sedentary behaviour and stress in adults. Methods A systematic search was conducted (January 1990 – September 2019). Following PRISMA guidelines, an evaluation of methodological quality, and best-evidence synthesis of associations between time in sedentary behaviour (including sitting time, TV viewing, computer use) and stress were presented. Twenty-six studies reporting on data from n = 72,795 people (age 18-98y, 62.7% women) were included. Results Across the studies ( n = 2 strong-, n = 10 moderate- and n = 14 weak-quality), there was insufficient evidence that overall time spent in sedentary behaviour and sitting time were associated with stress, particularly when using self-report measures of sedentary behaviour or stress. There was strong evidence of no association between TV viewing, or computer use and stress. Amongst studies using objective measures of sedentary behaviour and/or stress there was also strong evidence of no association. Conclusion Although previous research suggested sedentary behaviour may be linked to mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety, the evidence for an association between various types of sedentary behaviour and stress is limited in quality, and associations are either inconsistent or null. High-quality longitudinal/interventional research is required to confirm findings and determine the direction of associations between different contexts (i.e. purpose) and domains (i.e. leisure, occupational, transport) of sedentary behaviour and stress.

Association of Work-Related Sedentary Behavior With Mental Health and Work Engagement Among Japanese White- and Blue-Collar Workers

Number of 

Key takeaways:Decreased work-related sedentary behavior is associated with improved mental health and work engagement for white-collar workers, regardless of their occupation.

Abstract:Individuals and organizations, regardless of job type, should acknowledge that prolonged occupational sedentary behaviors interfere with work engagement and should take steps to reduce it for white-collar workers at this point. Objective This study investigated the association of work-related sedentary behavior with mental health and work engagement among white- and blue-collar workers. Methods An Internet survey was conducted among 1600 workers aged 20 to 59 years. A total of 1213 valid responses were analyzed to examine the association of work-related sedentary behavior with mental health and work engagement. Results Higher level of occupational sedentary behavior significantly associated with poorer mental health and lower work engagement among white-collar workers. Considering the effect of occupation, association of sedentary behavior with mental health disappeared, whereas association with work engagement remained for white-collar workers. Conclusions Our result suggested the importance of decreasing work-related sedentary behavior for enhancing work engagement regardless of the occupation for white-collar workers. Further study is needed to confirm the association between these variables for blue-collar workers.

Can physical activity counteract the negative effects of sedentary behavior on the physical and mental health of children and adolescents? A narrative review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regular moderate to vigorous physical activity can effectively prevent or improve the negative effects of sedentary behavior on children and adolescents' physical and mental health.

Abstract:Background The increase in sedentary behavior (SB) in children and adolescents is one of the major threats to global public health, and the relationship between physical activity (PA) and SB has always been a key topic. Methods The literature search was conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and Scopus, and 121 pieces of literature were included in this study after screening and evaluation. Results (1) SB caused by screen time such as mobile phones and TVs has varying degrees of negative impact on obesity, cardiovascular metabolism, skeletal muscle development, and cognitive, and psychological disorders in children and adolescents. (2) Regular physical activity could effectively prevent, offset, or improve the harm of SB to the physical and mental health of children and adolescents, mainly by reducing the incidence of obesity, and cardiovascular and metabolic risks, promoting skeletal muscle development, and improving cognitive function and mental health. (3) The mechanism of physical activity to prevent or ameliorate the harm of SB was relatively complex, mainly involving the inhibition or activation of neurobiomolecules, the improvement of blood and cell metabolic factors, and the enhancement of brain functional connectivity. Conclusions Children and adolescents should avoid excessive SB, and through a variety of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) to replace or intermittent SB, which could effectively prevent or improve the harm of SB to physical and mental health.

Impact of sedentary behaviour reduction on desk-worker workplace satisfaction, productivity, mood and health-related quality of life: a randomised trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:Reducing non-work sedentary behavior, rather than work sedentary behavior, may be more impactful for improving workplace satisfaction and health-related quality of life.

Abstract:Objectives Sedentary behaviour (SB) is related to lower worker health-related quality of life (HRQOL), mental health and productivity. However, it is unknown whether reducing SB improves these outcomes. This study assessed whether a 3-month SB reduction intervention improved or was associated with dose-response changes in workplace satisfaction, productivity, mood and HRQOL. Methods Inactive desk workers with elevated blood pressure were randomised to a 3-month SB reduction intervention (n=135) or control (n=136). The intervention used a sit-stand desk, wrist-worn activity prompter and bi-monthly individual coaching to primarily replace work SB with standing and stepping. SB measured via a thigh-mounted activPAL3 micro, workplace satisfaction, productivity, mood and HRQOL were assessed at baseline and 3 months. Analyses of covariance compared changes in outcomes between groups with adjustment for baseline values. In both groups, associations between changes in work and non-work SB and outcomes were examined using linear regression. Results Compared with control, reducing SB did not significantly change workplace satisfaction, productivity or HRQOL. Among mood measures, only vigour improved (1.01 vs 0.1 points, p=0.0302). Among all participants, reductions in non-work SB were associated with improvements in workplace satisfaction (+0.15 and +0.27 points/hour of non-work standing and stepping, respectively) and productivity (+0.47 points/hour of non-work stepping), while changes in SB during work were not related. Conclusions Interventions reducing non-work rather than work SB may be more impactful for improving workplace satisfaction and HRQOL outcomes. Future studies should explore workplace-based SB reduction interventions that are longer and target non-work time to improve similar outcomes. Trial registration number NCT03307343.

Non-Occupational Sitting and Mental Well-Being in Employed Adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior, including TV viewing, computer use, and total non-occupational sitting time, may negatively impact mental well-being in employed adults, with gender playing a moderating role.

Abstract:Emerging evidence suggests that sedentary behaviour may be adversely associated with physical health, but few studies have examined the association with mental well-being. This study examined the association of four non-occupational sedentary behaviours, individually and in total, with mental well-being in employed adults. Baseline data from the evaluation of Well@Work, a national workplace health promotion project conducted in the UK, were used. Participants self-reported sitting time whilst watching television, using a computer, socialising and travelling by motorised transport. Mental well-being was assessed by the 12-item version of the general health questionnaire. Analyses were conducted using multiple linear regression. In models adjusted for multiple confounders, TV viewing, computer use and total non-occupational sitting time were adversely associated with general health questionnaire-12 assessed mental well-being in women. Computer use only was found to be adversely associated with mental well-being in men. Sedentary behaviour may be adversely associated with mental well-being in employed adults. The association may be moderated by gender.

Sedentariness and Health: Is Sedentary Behavior More Than Just Physical Inactivity?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior, including cognitive work, is linked to metabolic risk and may increase glycemic instability, leading to higher energy intakes and potential solutions to reduce sedentary behaviors and increase physical activity.

Abstract:Sedentary behavior refers to certain activities in a reclining, seated, or lying position requiring very low energy expenditure. It has been suggested to be distinct from physical inactivity and an independent predictor of metabolic risk even if an individual meets current physical activity guidelines. Over the past decades, a shift in the activity profile of individuals has been observed with vigorous physical activity and sleep being partly replaced by cognitive work, a potential neurogenic stress component considering its hormonal and neurophysiological effects, leading to various impacts on health. Mental work, for instance, may significantly increase glycemic instability leading to an increase in the desire to eat and thus, higher energy intakes. Furthermore, screen-based leisure activities (e.g., television watching) and screen-based work activities (e.g., computer use for work purposes) have often been considered together while they may not trigger the same stress response and/or use of substrate. Thus, the problems of sedentariness may not only be attributed to a lack of movement, but also to the stimulation provided by replacing activities. The objective of this review is to discuss the (1) recent evidence and current state of knowledge regarding the health impact of sedentary behaviors on health; (2) potential neurogenic effects of cognitive work as a sedentary behavior; (3) link between sedentary behaviors and the diet; (4) resemblance between sedentary behaviors and the inadequate sleeper; and (5) potential solutions to reduce sedentary behaviors and increase physical activity.

Sedentary Behavior at Work and Cognitive Functioning: A Systematic Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior at work is not associated with changes in cognitive performance in interventions aimed at reducing it.

Abstract:Background: It is now well-established that sedentarity has a negative impact on the physiological functioning and health of humans, whereas very little is known about the psychological repercussions, especially in cognitive functioning. Yet, studying the cognitive effects of the sedentary lifestyle is particularly relevant in the short term for productivity and in the long term for cognitive health (accelerated aging). This systematic review therefore aims to make an inventory of the potential cognitive effects of sedentarity at the workplace.

Improving office workers’ mental health and cognition: a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial targeting physical activity and sedentary behavior in multi-component interventions

Number of 

Key takeaways:Multi-component interventions targeting physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior can improve mental health and cognition among office-workers.

Abstract:Physically inactive and sedentary lifestyles are negatively related to both mental health and cognition. For office-workers, who spend two-thirds of their workday sitting, it is important to improve these lifestyles. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of multi-component interventions, incorporating individual, environmental and organizational changes, to increase physical activity or reduce sedentary behavior among office-workers in order to improve mental health and cognition. a 3-arm, clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) with waiting list control group amongst adult office-workers of two large Swedish companies. Cluster teams will be randomized into 6-month interventions or to a passive waiting list control group which will receive the allocated intervention with a 6-month delay. Two multicomponent interventions will be studied of which one focuses on improving physical activity and the other on reducing sedentary behavior. Both interventions include 5 sessions of motivational counselling. In the physical activity intervention persons also get access to a gym and team leaders will organize lunch walks and encourage to exercise. In the sedentary behavior intervention standing- and walking meetings will be implemented and team leaders will encourage to reduce sitting. The recruitment target is 110 office-workers per arm (330 in total). Measurements will be repeated every 6 months for a total intended duration of 24 months. Proximal main outcomes are physical activity measured with accelerometers and sedentary behavior with inclinometers. Distal outcomes are self-reported mental health and a cognition test battery. Additional outcomes will include cardiovascular fitness, body composition, sleep, self-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior, other health habits, physical health, and working mechanisms from blood samples and questionnaires. This cluster RCT will contribute to the currently available evidence by comparing the effectiveness of multi-component interventions targeting physical activity or sedentary behavior with the end goal of improving mental health and cognition. This study is strong in its cluster randomized design, numerous objective outcome measures and long-term follow-up. The exact content of the interventions has been defined by combining theory with results from a larger research project as well as having a continuous dialogue with the involved companies.

Physical Exercise and Health, 5: Sedentary Time, Independent of Health-Related Physical Activity, as a Risk Factor for Adverse Physical Health and Mental Health Outcomes.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentariness, or excessive time spent in sedentary behaviors, is associated with adverse physical health and mental health outcomes, regardless of health-related physical activity levels.

Abstract:Medical and neuropsychiatric benefits associated with physical exercise and activity are well recognized. It is less well known that time spent in sedentary behaviors, such as television-viewing or sitting at a desk, are associated with adverse health outcomes even after taking into consideration health-related physical activity. Although sedentary behaviors have become common in daily life, people tend to substantially underestimate how sedentary they actually are. The average person spends nearly 10 hours per day in a sedentary state, during leisure activities or work; sedentariness is even greater in persons with major mental illness such as psychosis. This article explains what sedentariness is, why sedentary behaviors are common in daily life, and how sedentariness is defined and assessed. Sedentariness is an important concept in its own right; it is not merely an absence of health-related physical activity. Sedentariness is associated with adverse outcomes in children and adolescents, adults, and older adults. Examples are provided of associations between sedentariness and adverse medical outcomes such as the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and all cause mortality. Examples are also provided of associations between sedentariness and adverse mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and dementia. Importantly, the adverse associations are independent of health-related physical activity; however, higher levels of physical activity may attenuate or offset the adverse effects of sedentariness. It is hoped that this article will encourage readers to reduce sedentary behaviors with a view to improve long-term physical and mental health.

Musculoskeletal pain and sedentary behaviour in occupational and non-occupational settings: a systematic review with meta-analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Reducing workplace sitting is associated with reduced musculoskeletal pain conditions, with occupational sedentary behavior associations being occupation-dependent.

Abstract:Abstract Background Sedentary behaviour (SB; time spent sitting) is associated with musculoskeletal pain (MSP) conditions; however, no prior systematic review has examined these associations according to SB domains. We synthesised evidence on occupational and non-occupational SB and MSP conditions. Methods Guided by a PRISMA protocol, eight databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus, and AMED) and three grey literature sources (Google Scholar, WorldChat, and Trove) were searched (January 1, 2000, to March 17, 2021) for original quantitative studies of adults ≥ 18 years. Clinical-condition studies were excluded. Studies’ risk of bias was assessed using the QualSyst checklist. For meta-analyses, random effect inverse-variance pooled effect size was estimated; otherwise, best-evidence synthesis was used for narrative review. Results Of 178 potentially-eligible studies, 79 were included ; 56 studies were of high quality, with scores &gt; 0.75. Data for 26 were meta-synthesised. For cross-sectional studies of non-occupational SB, meta-analysis showed full-day SB to be associated with low back pain . Narrative synthesis found full-day SB associations with knee pain, arthritis, and general MSP, but the evidence was insufficient on associations with neck/shoulder pain, hip pain, and upper extremities pain. Evidence of prospective associations of full-day SB with MSP conditions was insufficient. Also, there was insufficient evidence on both cross-sectional and prospective associations between leisure-time SB and MSP conditions. For occupational SB, cross-sectional studies meta-analysed indicated associations of self-reported workplace sitting with LBP and neck/shoulder pain , but not with extremities pain . Best-evidence synthesis identified inconsistent findings on cross-sectional association and a probable negative prospective association of device-measured workplace sitting with LBP-intensity in tradespeople. There was cross-sectional evidence on the association of computer time with neck/shoulder pain, but insufficient evidence for LBP and general MSP. Experimental/intervention evidence indicated reduced LBP, neck/shoulder pain, and general MSP with reducing workplace sitting. Conclusions We found cross-sectional associations of occupational and non-occupational SB with MSP conditions, with occupational SB associations being occupation dependent, however, reverse causality bias cannot be ruled out. While prospective evidence was inconclusive, reducing workplace sitting was associated with reduced MSP conditions. Future studies should emphasise prospective analyses and examining potential interactions with chronic diseases. Protocol registration PROSPERO ID # CRD42020166412 (Amended to limit the scope)

Impact of sitting at work on musculoskeletal complaints of German workers - results from the study on mental health at work (S-MGA)

Number of 

Key takeaways:Increased sitting at work is associated with an increased prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints, but leisure time physical activity may counteract these effects.

Abstract:Abstract Introduction Sedentary behavior (including prolonged sitting) is a form of physical inactivity that has a negative impact on health, possibly including musculoskeletal complaints (MSCs). The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which time spent sitting at work is associated with the one-year prevalence of MSCs in the neck, shoulder, upper back/thoracic spine, and lower back among workers from the Study of Mental Health in the Workplace (S-MGA). In addition, the study also examined whether leisure time, physical activity, and sex modify the relationship between occupational sitting and MSCs. Methods For this analysis, we used the S-MGA, a 5-year prospective study in Germany. The S-MGA is a nationwide representative employee cohort study with a baseline survey in 2012 and a follow-up survey in 2017. Sitting at work was measured using a question asked at baseline. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used to determine the one-year prevalence of MSCs in the neck, shoulder, upper back, and lower back pain (yes/no). The assessment of MSCs was only conducted at the 2017 follow-up. Adjusted Poisson regression models were used to determine the association of baseline level of weekly hours spent sitting at work with MSCs during follow-up. In addition to unadjusted models, models were adjusted for demographic (age, sex, body mass index and occupational skill level), occupational (heavy lifting at work), psychological disorders and lifestyle factors (smoking status and leisure time physical activity), as well as preexisting musculoskeletal conditions reported at baseline. To examine whether the relationship between sitting time and pain was modified by sex and leisure time physical activity, the models were stratified for both these variables. Results Among the participants analyzed ( n = 2,082), 49.8% were male, while 50.2% were female, and more than 60% of the study population spent over half of their working hours in a sitting position. Exposure to increased sitting at work reported at baseline was not consistently associated with 12-month prevalence of MSCs in the upper body at follow-up. However, differences in the association between occupational sitting and MSCs were dependent on the intensity of leisure time physical activity. Prevalence ratios (PRs) indicated an increased prevalence of MSC in the neck (PR = 1.46; 95% CI = 1.18–1.80) and shoulder (PR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.03–1.64) in workers without leisure time physical activity who spent 25 to &lt; 35 weekly working hours sitting. Discussion These findings suggest that leisure time physical activity interacts with the relationship between sitting at work and MSCs. The relationship between sitting at work and musculoskeletal pain needs further investigation, but we found indications that leisure time physical activity may counter the effects of sitting at work.

Sedentary behaviour (especially accumulation pattern) has an independent negative impact on skeletal muscle size and architecture in community-dwelling older adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary behavior, regardless of habitual physical activities, should be short and frequently interrupted to maintain muscle size and architecture in older adults.

Abstract:Prolonged sedentary behaviour (SB) i.e. longer bouts, is suggested to have a range of negative health effects, independent of habitual light and medium-to-vigorous physical activity (LIPA or MVPA). Any effect on musculoskeletal size, architecture or morphology has seldom been reported in older adults. Moreover, no study has yet determined if any association would persist following adjustment for covariates. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between SB, and properties of the Gastrocnemius Medialis (GM) muscle, in a cross-sectional sample of older adults using compositional data analysis. 105 healthy older adults (73±6y) wore a thigh mounted tri-axial accelerometer for seven consecutive days, and underwent ultrasound , body composition (e.g. DEXA) and health (e.g. medical history) assessments. In-unadjusted models, SB time was negatively associated with ACSA at 75% of Lm (R2adj = 0.085), VM (R2adj = 0.020), and PCSA (R2adj = 0.039). Standing was positively associated with pennation angle (R2adj = 0.110), which persisted following co-variate adjustment (R2adj = 0.296). In fully adjusted models, both SB & LIPA time were associated with ACSA at 75% of Lm (Both R2adj = 0.393). Standing and light activity time were also associated with LF, VM, & PCSA (R2adj 0.116–0.573). In fully adjusted models, SB pattern parameters (i.e. the manner in which sedentary behaviour is accumulated daily throughout waking hours such as the timing, duration and frequency of sedentary bouts), were associated with GM muscle properties (R2adj 0.156–0.564) including LM, LF, and VM. The pattern, rather than accumulated daily SB time, was associated with the size and architecture of the GM. Our results suggest that regardless of co-existing habitual physical activities, SB bouts should be kept short and frequently interrupted to offset some of the deleterious ageing-related muscle architecture characteristics changes.

INFLUENCE OF SEDENTIAL TYPES OF PROFESSIONS ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF WOMEN

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary professions in Armenia, such as programming, banking, and marketing, can negatively impact women's musculoskeletal system and cause chronic back pain, but regular physical activity can prevent and eliminate these issues.

Abstract:The aim of the research is to reveal the impact of technological professions prevalent on the musculoskeletal system of women at age 25-40 in the Republic of Armenia.
The top professions in Armenia like programming, banking, finances, accounting, marketing, are a fully computerized workflow, where employees have a sedentary lifestyle, 5 days a week, lasting 40 hours or more.
The results of a sociological survey conducted among 500 women at age 25-40 prove the impact of sedentary professions in the Republic of Armenia on the musculoskeletal system, their physical preparedness and health.
The results of the survey showed that most of the participants have musculoskeletal problems, chronic pain, and insomnia. The study of professional literature shows that regular physical activity can prevent pain, as well as eliminate the problem.
Summarizing the analysis of literary sources and the results of the survey it can be concluded that nowadays, after working for 8 to 10 hours in a variety of sedentary professions, 25-40-year-old women can have mental tension and stress, which has a negative impact on health, particularly the musculoskeletal system. It can cause also chronic back pain.
Surveys and studies of professional literature as well showed that regular physical activity can prevent pain syndrome, as well as eliminate the problem completely.

The Short Term Musculoskeletal and Cognitive Effects of Prolonged Sitting During Office Computer Work

Number of 

Key takeaways:Prolonged sitting during office computer work increases musculoskeletal discomfort and negatively impacts cognitive function, suggesting the need for regular breaks.

Abstract:Office workers are exposed to high levels of sedentary time. In addition to cardio-vascular and metabolic health risks, this sedentary time may have musculoskeletal and/or cognitive impacts on office workers. Participants (n = 20) undertook two hours of laboratory-based sitting computer work to investigate changes in discomfort and cognitive function (sustained attention and problem solving), along with muscle fatigue, movement and mental state. Over time, discomfort increased in all body areas (total body IRR : 1.43 ) reaching clinically meaningful levels in the low back and hip/thigh/buttock areas. Creative problem solving errors increased (β = 0.25 ) while sustained attention did not change. There was no change in erector spinae, trapezius, rectus femoris, biceps femoris and external oblique median frequency or amplitude; low back angle changed towards less lordosis, pelvis movement increased, and mental state deteriorated. There were no substantial correlations between discomfort and cognitive function. The observed changes suggest prolonged sitting may have consequences for musculoskeletal discomfort and cognitive function and breaks to interrupt prolonged sitting are recommended.

Muscle tightness leads to an imbalance in acting on the joint and in the long term can lead to pain and weakness and can cause several problems which can lead to have difficulties while walking and doing other activities. Flexibility is vital component of fitness for musculoskeletal functioning and maximizing the performance of physical activities And sedentary lifestyle can hamper the flexibility of the muscles. Tightness in muscles also reduces the range of motion .So there is need to aware people about the risk factors for poor health due to sedentary lifestyle. Hence the aim was to find the muscle tightness due to sitting for minimum 7 to 8 hrs at one place. Method: In this consecutive study, 60 subjects were taken with working for 7 hours or more per day between age group 20-60 yrs, were included which consisted of 42% of females and 58% of males respectively. Thus tests such as ober’s test, sit and reach test and straight leg raise test were performed. Result: The tests which were correlated with the duration of working hours of sitting for more than 6-7 hours and the results showed that the ober’s test was positive in 47% subjects. According to straight leg raise test the test was positive in 42% subjects and 53% subjects have fair flexibility according to sit and reach test. Conclusion: By this study, it was found that there was 47% of prevalence of iliotibial band tightness in subjects who were being sedentary for more than 7 hours per day with p value of <0.0001.

Key takeaways:Sedentary work poses significant health and safety risks, with musculoskeletal disorders being a major health and cost issue in European companies.

Abstract:Recent research shows that musculoskeletal disorders remain a major health and cost problem and their importance is growing. This is reflected in the fact that musculoskeletal disorders are one of the top three concerns for European companies. The Community strategy on health and safety at work highlights the importance of better adapting the workplace to individual needs and the effective application of key ergonomic principles in workplace design and work organisation. Despite continuous efforts, musculoskeletal disorders - back, neck and upper limb - remain a major health and cost burden. The work-body position has a similar perception, with relatively small outliers, but the proportion of working time spent on manual handling or repetitive hand or arm movements is steadily increasing. Recent European research also demonstrates that musculoskeletal disorders - back, neck and upper limb - remain a major health and cost problem and their importance is increasing. This is also indicated by the fact that musculoskeletal disorders are among the top three causes of concern for occupational health and safety in European companies. This is why we chose to focus our research on a comprehensive assessment of the potential risks associated with sedentary work and to investigate the risk analysis methods that can be applied, using a laboratory work example.

Movement Behavior and Health Outcomes among Sedentary Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Increasing standing time, walking time, and transitions between postures during both work and leisure time is associated with positive musculoskeletal and cardiometabolic health indicators among sedentary office workers.

Abstract:Background: Sedentary behavior, which is highly prevalent among office workers, is associated with multiple health disorders, including those of the musculoskeletal and cardiometabolic systems. Although prior studies looked at postures or physical activity during work or leisure time, few analyzed both posture and movement throughout the entire day. Objective: This cross-sectional pilot study examined the movement behavior of sedentary office workers during both work and leisure time to explore its association with musculoskeletal discomfort (MSD) and cardiometabolic health indicators. Methods: Twenty-six participants completed a survey and wore a thigh-based inertial measuring unit (IMU) to quantify the time spent in different postures, the number of transitions between postures, and the step count during work and leisure time. A heart rate monitor and ambulatory blood pressure cuff were worn to quantify cardiometabolic measures. The associations between movement behavior, MSD, and cardiometabolic health indicators were evaluated. Results: The number of transitions differed significantly between those with and without MSD. Correlations were found between MSD, time spent sitting, and posture transitions. Posture transitions had negative correlations with body mass index and heart rate. Conclusions: Although no single behavior was highly correlated with health outcomes, these correlations suggest that a combination of increasing standing time, walking time, and the number of transitions between postures during both work and leisure time was associated with positive musculoskeletal and cardiometabolic health indicators among sedentary office workers and should be considered in future research.

Key takeaways:Sedentary work negatively impacts employees' health, leading to musculoskeletal disorders and conditions, affecting productivity and efficiency.

Abstract:In recent years, Occupational Health is undoubtedly a significant factor of interest to employees, employers and the very society in which businesses operate in. 
 
The promotion of health (both physical and psychological) in the workplace is a joint effort of all the employees at any administrative level they happen to be at. The overall goal is to build and create the optimal work conditions in order to improve their well-being within the work place. 
 
Sedentary work appears to have a negative impact on employees health, by developing pain symptoms that express on their body as musculoskeletal disorders and conditions. 
 
Undoubtedly, the medical history of every employee, that works an excessive amount of hours, in combination with the negative correlations a sedentary work has on the physical body can exacerbate his/hers state of health to a point that efficiency and productivity is affected. 
 
In this essay we analyze all types of musculoskeletal troubles and the reasons that cause them, as well as the precautionary measures, with the aim of reducing the harmful effects on the health of the workers as defined by the ergonomics. 
 
In order to record and highlight the main musculoskeletal disorders or other symptoms experienced by an employee nowadays, the daily activity of 15 office workers for 15 days was monitored via a dedicated biometrics portable device. 
 
More specifically, the employees that took part in this research for this thesis wore the biometrics device (pacemaker), from the start of their day until the end of it and their return back home. 
 
The device recorded the total activity of each participant, specifically the calorie consumption as well as the traveling distance from and to the workplace. 
 
The results of the research in this study, regarding the effects on the physical health of office workers, can be used by businesses to capture their possible deviations from the ergonomic standards and to improve working conditions of their employees. 
 
It also proposes solutions to employers who emphasize on the positive outcome of activating their staff so that they feel healthy and active, variables that will increase both the productivity and the overall performance of the employees as well as the performance in fulfilling their duties.

Comparison of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders between Sedentary Work and Standing Work in Korea

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentary work is associated with higher rates of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, while standing work is considered to have healthier effects.

Abstract:Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are known as chronic health hazards in the musculoskeletal system, resulting from minute injuries mainly in the joint regions and caused by repetitive manual work, inconvenient and awkward working postures, high labor intensity, excessive force, insufficient rest, cold working environments, or vibrations. The purpose of the present study is to judge whether low back pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms appear more significantly in sedentary work or standing work. The present study was conducted with 109 production workers of an electronic product manufacturing business that implement assembling processes along the flow of conveyor belts with typical sedentary work for eight working hours per day. In addition, it also included 116 production workers of a car component manufacturing business located in Gyeonggi-do that implement assembling processes in cell lines with typical standing work for eight working hours per day. More sedentary workers were shown to be pain complainants (21.1%) and management targets (54.1%) that felt pain in at least one region. Many complained of pain in the shoulder (15.6%) and the percentage of management targets among them was shown to be higher than standing workers were. As almost 70% of standing workers experiencing many physical burdens were shown to be healthy, except for those who were shown to be pain complainants, standing work is assumed to have healthy effects. As well, given that only 24.8% of sedentary workers were shown to be normal, sedentary workers should be managed through appropriate exercise therapy or health management.

Moderate‐to‐Vigorous Physical Activity But Not Sedentary Time Is Associated With Musculoskeletal Health Outcomes in a Cohort of Australian Middle‐Aged Women

Number of 

Key takeaways:Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is more important than light physical activity or sedentary time for improving musculoskeletal health in middle-aged women.

Abstract:Associations between physical activity and time spent sedentary and musculoskeletal outcomes remain unclear in middle‐aged adults. This study aimed to describe associations between objectively‐measured physical activity and sedentary time and musculoskeletal health outcomes in middle‐aged women. This cross‐sectional study from a population‐based sample of 309 women (age 36 to 57 years) examined associations of total physical activity (accelerometer counts/min of wear time), and time spent sedentary, in light physical activities and moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activities (MVPA) (by Actigraph GT1M accelerometer) with lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) bone mineral density (BMD) (by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry), lower limb muscle strength (LMS), and functional mobility and balance tests (timed up and go test , functional reach test , lateral reach test , and step test ) using linear regression. Total physical activity was beneficially associated with FN BMD (values are β; 95% CI) (0.011 g/cm2; 95% CI, 0.003 to 0.019 g/cm2), LMS (2.13 kg; 95% CI, 0.21 to 4.06 kg), and TUG (–0.080 s; 95% CI, –0.129 to –0.030 s), after adjustment for confounders. MVPA was also beneficially associated with FN BMD (0.0050 g/cm2; 95% CI, 0.0007 to 0.0094 g/cm2), LMS (1.48 kg; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.52 kg), ST (0.12 steps; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.23 steps), and TUG (–0.043 s; 95% CI, –0.070 to –0.016 s). Associations between MVPA and LMS, TUG and ST persisted after further adjustment for sedentary time. Only TUG was associated with sedentary time, with a detrimental effect (0.075 s; 95% CI, 0.013 to 0.137 s) and this did not persist after further adjustment for MVPA. Light physical activity was not associated with any outcome. MVPA appears more important than light physical activity or sedentary time for many musculoskeletal outcomes in middle‐aged women. This needs to be considered when developing interventions to improve habitual physical activity that aim to improve musculoskeletal health. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Aktuelle Evidenz zu Umfang und gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen von arbeitsbezogenem sedentärem Verhalten

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sedentariness in work can lead to chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancers, but the long-term negative effects on cognitive performance and musculoskeletal disorders remain inconclusive.

Abstract:Findings on the duration and volume of sedentary behavior during leisure time and work as well as evidence on the health effects were initially derived from questionnaire-based epidemiological studies and bed rest experiments. In order to determine the relevance of sedentary behavior as a work-related risk factor, objective epidemiological data and clear evidence of the pathomechanisms are necessary. This narrative review analyzes the current evidence on the epidemiology of sedentary behavior and the causal relationship with risk factors and chronic diseases using English and German language databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane). With respect to the duration of occupational sedentary behavior, the data from English language reviews and currently available German language observational studies vary considerably within a range of 4–7 h per day. A large number of experimental studies have confirmed the positive effects of interrupting sedentary behavior on selected metabolic markers. Longitudinal studies indicated a causal relationship between chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, prostate, endometrial, colorectal, breast and lung cancers) and sedentary behavior. Studies that confirm the underlying pathomechanisms of long-term negative effects of sedentary behavior are still pending. The number of studies assessing the specific risks of sedentary behavior during occupational time is relatively small. The evidence concerning detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on cognitive performance or on musculoskeletal disorders, such as back or neck pain is inconclusive. An objective assessment of the epidemiology of sedentary behavior in different occupational groups and a longitudinal analysis of the correlation with relevant health outcomes should be the subject of future research.

Musculoskeletal pain in multiple body sites and work ability in the general working population: cross-sectional study among 10,000 wage earners

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher pain intensity in multiple body sites is associated with lower work ability, affecting both young and old workers, sedentary and physical workers.

Abstract:Abstract Background and aims Musculoskeletal pain may negatively affect work ability, especially when work demands are high and/or physical capacity of the worker is low. This study investigated the association between intensity of musculoskeletal pain in multiple body regions and work ability among young and old workers with sedentary and physical demanding jobs. Methods Currently employed wage earners (n=10,427) replied to questions about pain intensity, work ability, and physical work demands. The odds ratio (OR) for having a lower level of work ability in relation to the physical demands at work were modeled using logistic regression controlled for various confounders. Results The OR for lower work ability increased with higher pain intensity in all regions among workers with sedentary and physical work. The same pattern was observed among workers <50 years and ≥50 years in both work types. The association was quite consistent across age and work activity groups, although it tended to be more pronounced among those with physically demanding work in some of pain regions. Conclusions This study shows that increasing pain intensity in multiple sites of the body is associated with lower work ability. This was seen for both younger and older workers as well as those with sedentary and physical work. Implications Physical workers with multiple-site pain may especially be at increased risk of the consequences of reduced work ability. Therefore, extra attention is needed and this group may benefit from better targeted preventive measures.

One musculoskeletal health: towards optimizing musculoskeletal health in Egypt—how to be a bone and muscle builder by the Egyptian Academy of Bone Health and Metabolic Bone Diseases

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regular exercise can reduce bone and muscle loss and prevent age-related increases in body fat in the elderly.

Abstract:Abstract Background Musculoskeletal disorders are common problems that affect the elderly. They severely restrict mobility and dexterity, resulting in early retirement from work, lower levels of well-being, and reduced ability to participate in society. With the increase in life expectancy, the older populations are dreaming of active, painless, and independent lives in the face of functional limitations that are the result of various comorbidities with age progression. Main text The aim of the study is to highlight aging changes in the musculoskeletal system, risk factors that may have a negative impact on musculoskeletal, as well as strategies to optimize musculoskeletal health in the elderly. A narrative review was conducted through a series of literature searches in the database MEDLINE/PubMed focusing on musculoskeletal health. The search terms used were “muscle building,” “bone building,” “osteoporosis,” “osteopenia,” “sarcopenia,” “osteosarcopenia,” “fractures,” “falls,” “functional ability,” “nutrition,” “diet,” “obesity,” “comorbidity,” and “medication.” Data extraction was carried out by the investigators using a standardized data collection form with subsequent discussion among the authors. Peer-reviewed observational controlled and non-controlled studies (case–control and cohort studies) were selected. The data collected in the selected articles were all related to musculoskeletal health. Conclusion Many of the changes in the musculoskeletal system result more from disuse than from simple aging. Less than 10% of the Egyptian population participate in regular exercise, and the most sedentary group is older than 50 years of age. Long-term regular exercises may reduce the loss of bone and muscle mass and prevent age-associated increases in body fat.

Review On Health-Risks Related To Sedentary lifestyle among Youth

Key takeaways:Sedentary lifestyles in youth increase the risk of death, cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, depression, and cognitive impairment.

Abstract:A third of people worldwide who are 15 years of
age or older do not exercise enough, which has an
impact on their health. But little is known about the
dangers sedentary habits cause to one's health.
Because there are fewer places to exercise, more
people are engaging in sedentary jobs like office
work, and television and video devices are
becoming more and more common in daily life,
inactive lifestyles are becoming more and more
commonplace worldwide. As a result, the related
health issues are getting worse. The effects of a
sedentary lifestyle on the human body are
multifaceted. Exercise that causes inactivity lowers
muscle glucose, protein transporter activities,
lipoprotein lipase activity, lipid metabolism, and
carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, it stimulates
the sympathetic nervous system and lowers cardiac
output and systemic blood flow, which ultimately
lowers insulin sensitivity and vascular function. It
also alters the insulin-like growth factor axis and
the circulation levels of sex hormones, which
elevates the incidence of hormone-related cancers.
Increased sedentary time impairs the gravitostat,
the body’s weight homeostat, and weight gain,
adiposity, and elevated chronic inflammation
caused by sedentary behaviour are risk factors for
cancer. Sedentary behaviours have wide-ranging
adverse impacts on the human body including
increased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
disease mortality, cancer risk, and risks of
metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia; musculoskeletal
disorders such as arthralgia and osteoporosis;
depression; and, cognitive impairment. Therefore,
reducing sedentary behaviours and increasing
physical activity are both important to promote
public health.
