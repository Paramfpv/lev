The negative impact of overeating on health and longevity

Overeating is one of the main risk factors for chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and mental disorders. Regular excess calorie intake leads to an increase in body fat, which worsens body composition and triggers metabolic changes that can lead to serious health consequences. Overeating, especially at night, intensifies these negative effects, contributing to increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.

Overeating leads to excessive fat accumulation in the body, which negatively affects a range of metabolic processes, including insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. Additionally, excess calories affect hormone levels responsible for hunger and satiety, which can further increase appetite and deepen weight problems. Prolonged overeating may result in lasting changes in body structure and organ function, including the heart and circulatory system.

Overeating leads to serious health problems, especially in the long term. Scientific evidence indicates that regular excessive calorie consumption has a strong impact on health, leading to the development of obesity and its associated diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, as well as mental health problems. The high risk of health complications associated with overeating is well documented in epidemiological studies and meta-analyses.

The scale of overeating is enormous, especially in developed countries, where excessive food intake is often the result of the availability of cheap, highly processed foods. This problem is closely linked to the rising numbers of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease cases worldwide. Additionally, overeating also has a broad impact on the environment, leading to food waste and increased greenhouse gas emissions associated with overproduction of food.

Pay attention to portion size

One way to control overeating is to consciously manage portion sizes. Using smaller plates and avoiding snacking between meals can help reduce calorie intake.

Preparing meals in advance allows for better control over what and when you eat, reducing the risk of reaching for unhealthy snacks.

Avoid eating late at night

Nighttime overeating has a particularly negative impact on metabolic health. Developing healthy eating habits during the day and avoiding meals after 7:00 pm can improve both physical and mental health.

Identify emotional triggers

Understanding which emotions lead to overeating is crucial. It's worth working on healthy ways of coping with stress, such as meditation, talking to loved ones, or physical activity.

Overeating, meaning the consumption of more calories than the energy requirement, has a clearly negative impact on body composition. It mainly leads to an increase in fat mass, and changes in muscle mass depend on diet composition, but a calorie surplus almost always results in increased fat tissue.

The impact of overeating on body composition

Summary of research: Overeating and body composition

Overeating, especially in response to emotions or with a loss of control, is strongly associated with deteriorated mental health. People who overeat more often experience depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and other emotional problems.

Final comment:Overeating, especially in the context of excessive food consumption, has strong scientific support based on numerous epidemiological studies, meta-analyses, and controlled trials. There is solid evidence indicating a direct impact of overeating on health, particularly regarding obesity, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health. Studies show clear correlations between overeating and negative health outcomes, both in the short and long term.

Collateral fattening: When a deficit in lean body mass drives overeating

Number of 

Key takeaways:A deficit in lean body mass can drive overeating, potentially impacting appetite control and understanding dieting and sedentariness mechanisms.

Abstract:In his last review entitled “Some Adventures in Body Composition,” Gilbert Forbes reminded us that “lean body mass and body fat are in a sense companions.” To what extent the lean body mass (or fat‐free mass) component in this companionship impacts on energy intake is rarely a topic for discussion, amid a dominant adipocentric view of appetite control. Yet an analysis of the few human studies that have investigated the relationships between objectively measured food intake and body composition reveals a potentially important role for both an increase and a decrease in fat‐free mass in the drive to eat. These studies are highlighted here, together with the implications of their findings for research directed as much toward the elucidation of peripheral signals and energy‐sensing mechanisms that drive hunger and appetite, as toward understanding the mechanisms by which dieting and sedentariness predispose to fatness.

Carbohydrate-insulin model: does the conventional view of obesity reverse cause and effect?

Number of 

Key takeaways:The carbohydrate-insulin model suggests that obesity is driven by storing excess fat, not overeating, and a diet lowering insulin secretion may be more effective for long-term weight management and chronic disease prevention.

Abstract:Conventional obesity treatment, based on the First Law of Thermodynamics, assumes that excess body fat gain is driven by overeating, and that all calories are metabolically alike in this regard. Hence, to lose weight one must ultimately eat less and move more. However, this prescription rarely succeeds over the long term, in part because calorie restriction elicits predictable biological responses that oppose ongoing weight loss. The carbohydrate-insulin model posits the opposite causal direction: overeating doesn't drive body fat increase; instead, the process of storing excess fat drives overeating. A diet high in rapidly digestible carbohydrates raises the insulin-to-glucagon ratio, shifting energy partitioning towards storage in adipose, leaving fewer calories for metabolically active and fuel sensing tissues. Consequently, hunger increases, and metabolic rate slows in the body's attempt to conserve energy. A small shift in substrate partitioning though this mechanism could account for the slow but progressive weight gain characteristic of common forms of obesity. From this perspective, the conventional calorie-restricted, low-fat diet amounts to symptomatic treatment, failing to target the underlying predisposition towards excess fat deposition. A dietary strategy to lower insulin secretion may increase the effectiveness of long-term weight management and chronic disease prevention. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Causes of obesity: theories, conjectures and evidence (Part II)’.

Rapid suppression of growth hormone concentration by overeating: potential mediation by hyperinsulinemia.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating for a few days rapidly suppresses growth hormone secretion without measurable weight gain, and chronic hyperinsulinemia does not further suppress GH secretion after 2 weeks.

Abstract:CONTEXT
The very low GH concentration in obesity is commonly attributed to high body fat mass; however, the influence of overeating on GH secretion is not clear.

OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study was to examine the effects of 2 wk of overeating on changes in GH secretion.

SETTING
Subjects were admitted to the hospital and stayed within the Michigan Clinical Research Unit throughout the entire 2-wk overeating period.

PARTICIPANTS
We studied seven healthy, nonobese men (body mass index, 24 ± 1 kg/m(2); age, 25 ± 1 yr).

INTERVENTION
Subjects ate standardized meals containing 70 kcal/kg fat free mass/d (∼4000 kcal/d) for 2 wk.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Twenty-four-hour plasma concentrations of GH (every 20 min) and insulin (every 2 h) were measured before overeating (baseline), on d 3, and after 2 wk of overeating.

RESULTS
Compared with baseline, average 24-h plasma GH concentration declined nearly 80% by d 3 of overeating (1.30 ± 0.18 vs. 0.36 ± 0.09 ng/ml; P = 0.01). This marked suppression of GH secretion occurred in the absence of an increase in body weight (77.0 ± 2.2 vs. 76.4 ± 2.4 kg). At the same time, average 24-h insulin concentration doubled (16.6 ± 2.1 vs. 31.7 ± 5.8 μU/ml; P = 0.009). After 2 wk, body weight significantly increased (79.0 ± 2.1 kg; P < 0.001), and body fat increased by more than 10% (P = 0.002). However, this did not induce a further suppression in plasma GH concentration (0.33 ± 0.08 ng/ml).

CONCLUSION
Only a few days of overeating markedly suppressed GH secretion before any measurable weight gain and was accompanied by chronic hyperinsulinemia. Increased body weight and body fat by 2 wk of overeating did not further suppress GH secretion.

Stress-induced hyperphagia: empirical characterization of stress-overeaters

Number of 

Key takeaways:Stress-overeating affects a large proportion of the surveyed population, with BMI, personality, and eating motives playing additional roles in identifying individuals at risk for unhealthy stress-related eating patterns.

Abstract:Abstract Background Stressful situations can have an impact on an individual’s eating behavior. People vulnerable to the influence of stress tend to change the quantity and quality of their food intake. Variables such as sex and body mass index (BMI) seem to be related to this stress-eating behavior, but it is rather unclear what factors account to the parameters associated with stress-eating behavior. The aim of this survey was to identify further characteristics of adults in Germany related to stress-overeating, focusing on stress perception, coping, eating motives and comfort foods as well as personality types. Methods This online survey was performed throughout Germany and comprised a 38-item pre-tested questionnaire. Stress-induced overeating was classified based on the Salzburg Stress Eating Scale (SSES). Moreover, validated questionnaires were used to identify additional characteristics of stress eaters. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling approach, and data were collected between January and April 2021. Results The overall sample consisted of 1222 participants (female 80.8%, aged 31.5±12.8). 42.1% of participants were identified as stress-overeaters. Among the remaining group, 78.9% stated to eat less, 21.1% to eat equally when stressed. Female participants had a higher mean SSES score compared to male participants. The BMI was positively correlated to SSES, r(1220)=0.28, p&gt;0.005 . ‘Agreeableness’ (BigFive) was found to be a negative predictor of stress-overeating. The most pronounced difference in eating motives (The Eating Motivation Survey, TEMS) was found for ‘Affect Regulation’ and ‘Weight Control’. Conclusions The results indicate that stress-overeating affects a large proportion of the surveyed population. BMI, personality and eating motives additionally characterize stress-overeaters and may contribute to develop new approaches to address unhealthy stress-related eating patterns.

Carbohydrates, fats, and satiety.

Number of 

Key takeaways:A low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with high fiber content is the best dietary advice for weight maintenance and controlling hunger.

Abstract:The macronutrient composition of the diet can influence hunger, satiety, food intake, body weight, and body composition. Fat, not carbohydrate, is the macronutrient associated with overeating and obesity. Fat is overeaten because it is highly palatable and because it provides a high level of energy in a given volume of food. However, when given in equal volumes, carbohydrate (sugar) and fat have similar effects on hunger, satiety, and subsequent food intake when infused intragastrically or ingested in foods by normal-weight, unrestrained young men. In obese and restrained subjects, preloads of high-carbohydrate yogurts suppress subsequent food intake more than do high-fat yogurts, indicating a relative insensitivity to the satiety value of fat. Both the amount of fat in the diet and total energy intake should be managed in weight-loss regimens. Low-fat foods and fat substitutes can help to reduce fat intake. Although more data are required, currently the best dietary advice for weight maintenance and for controlling hunger is to consume a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with a high fiber content.

Mediating role of exercise in the relationship between body dissatisfaction and overeating using structural equation modeling

Key takeaways:Exercise mediates the relationship between body dissatisfaction and overeating in college students, potentially offering strategies to reduce dissatisfaction and prevent overeating.

Abstract:With the rapid development of society, teenagers have more access to individuals with perfect bodies and are becoming more concerned about their body image. Currently, few studies assess body image and eating disorders comprehensively in China. Given the seriousness of these issues, there is an urgent need to understand the current state of body image and eating behaviors among Chinese people and formulate preventive strategies. In this study, 1711 college students between 17 and 23 years old in southern China completed relevant anthropometric measurements, essential information and three questionnaires. Multiple linear regression was used to screen the variables, and sex invariant analysis was used to determine whether to separate men and women to fit the structural equation model. Finally, the path diagram of the structural equation model was used to explore the complex relationship between body dissatisfaction and overeating. Our results found that 69.4% of participants with a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range were dissatisfied with their weight. Further, body dissatisfaction directly or indirectly leads to overeating. Additionally, exercise played a mediating role in the body dissatisfaction and overeating of college students. If BMI directs body dissatisfaction, it may lead to overeating. As a mediating factor in structural equation modelling, exercise may provide strategies to reduce body dissatisfaction and prevent overeating.

Effect of dietary protein content on weight gain, energy expenditure, and body composition during overeating: a randomized controlled trial.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating leads to increased body fat, but protein affects energy expenditure and lean body mass storage, but not body fat storage.

Abstract:CONTEXT
The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation in humans is unclear.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effects of overconsumption of low, normal, and high protein diets on weight gain, energy expenditure, and body composition.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A single-blind, randomized controlled trial of 25 US healthy, weight-stable male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years with a body mass index between 19 and 30. The first participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005 and the last in October 2007.

INTERVENTION
After consuming a weight-stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days, participants were randomized to diets containing 5% of energy from protein (low protein), 15% (normal protein), or 25% (high protein), which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10- to 12-week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit. Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period, the protein diets provided approximately 40% more energy intake, which corresponds to 954 kcal/d (95% CI, 884-1022 kcal/d).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry biweekly, resting energy expenditure was measured weekly by ventilated hood, and total energy expenditure by doubly labeled water prior to the overeating and weight stabilization periods and at weeks 7 to 8.

RESULTS
Overeating produced significantly less weight gain in the low protein diet group (3.16 kg; 95% CI, 1.88-4.44 kg) compared with the normal protein diet group (6.05 kg; 95% CI, 4.84-7.26 kg) or the high protein diet group (6.51 kg; 95% CI, 5.23-7.79 kg) (P = .002). Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50% to more than 90% of the excess stored calories. Resting energy expenditure, total energy expenditure, and body protein did not increase during overfeeding with the low protein diet. In contrast, resting energy expenditure (normal protein diet: 160 kcal/d ; high protein diet: 227 kcal/d ) and body protein (lean body mass) (normal protein diet: 2.87 kg ; high protein diet: 3.18 kg ) increased significantly with the normal and high protein diets.

CONCLUSIONS
Among persons living in a controlled setting, calories alone account for the increase in fat; protein affected energy expenditure and storage of lean body mass, but not body fat storage.

Energy expenditure and subsequent nutrient intakes in overfed young men.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating leads to significant decreases in voluntary energy intake and fat intake, contributing significantly to body weight regulation in young men.

Abstract:We investigated the mechanisms of body weight regulation in young men of normal body weight leading unrestricted lives. Changes in total and resting energy expenditure, body composition, and subsequent voluntary nutrient intakes in response to overeating by 4,230 +/- 115 (SE) kJ/day (1,011 +/- 27 kcal/day) for 21 days were measured in seven subjects consuming a typical diet. On average, 85-90% of the excess energy intake was deposited (with 87% of this amount in fat and 13% in protein on average). There was no detectable difference between individuals in susceptibility to energy deposition. The resting metabolic rate, averaged for fasting and fed states, increased during overfeeding (mean +/- SE, 628 +/- 197 kJ/day, P less than 0.01), but at least some of this amount was obligatory expenditure associated with nutrient assimilation. No significant increase in energy expenditure for physical activity or thermoregulation resulted from overfeeding. Thus energy expenditure did not substantially adapt to increased energy intake. However, significant decreases in voluntary energy intake (1,991 +/- 824 kJ/day, P less than 0.05) and fat intake (48 +/- 11 g/day, P less than 0.01) followed overeating, indicating that adaptive changes in nutrient intakes can contribute significantly to body weight regulation after overeating.

Daily mindfulness, negative affect, and eating behaviors in adolescents at risk for excess weight gain.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Greater daily mindfulness in adolescents with high weight is associated with less loss-of-control/overeating, suggesting its importance for healthier eating patterns in their daily lives.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
Loss-of-control and overeating are common in adolescents with high body mass index (BMI). Mindfulness may affect negative affect, and both may relate to loss-of-control and overeating. Yet, there is limited understanding of these associations in adolescents' daily lives.

METHODS
Forty-five adolescents (77% female; Mage  = 14.4 years, SDage  = 1.7 years) with high weight (92% with BMI ≥85th percentile for age/sex) provided daily, repeated measurements of mindfulness, negative affect, loss-of-control, and overeating for ~7 days (M = 5.6 days; range = 1-13). Multilevel mixed modeling was conducted to test within-person (intraindividual) and between-person (interindividual) associations for the same-day (concurrent) and next-day (time-ordered/prospective).

RESULTS
There were within-person and between-person associations of higher mindfulness with lower negative affect on the same-day and next-day. Greater between-person mindfulness related to lower odds of adolescents' loss-of-control occurrence (same-day) and conversely, more perceived control over eating (same-day and next-day). Greater within-person mindfulness related to less odds of next-day overeating.

DISCUSSION
Dynamic relations exist among mindfulness, negative affect, and eating in adolescents at-risk for excess weight gain. Mindfulness may be an important element to consider in loss-of-control and overeating. Future work using momentary-data within an experimental design would help disentangle the intraindividual effects of increasing mindfulness/decreasing negative affect on disordered eating.

PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE
Loss-of-control and overeating are common in teenagers with high weight. Greater mindfulness-present-moment, non-judgmental attention-and less negative emotions may relate to healthier eating, but we do not know how these processes play out in teenagers' daily lives. Addressing this knowledge gap, the current findings showed that greater daily mindfulness, but not negative affect, related to less loss-of-control/overeating, suggesting the importance of mindfulness for eating patterns in teenagers' daily lives.

Diet, exercise or diet with exercise: comparing the effectiveness of treatment options for weight-loss and changes in fitness for adults (18–65 years old) who are overfat, or obese; systematic review and meta-analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Exercise combined with diet, particularly resistance training, is more effective than endurance training for altering body composition and reducing metabolic issues in adults who are overfat.

Abstract:There are number of means of methods to alter body composition, and metabolic issues, available for the adult who is overfat. The following is a systematic review and meta-analysis focused on comparing changes from treatment program for adults who are overfat based on analysis of aggregated effect size (ES) of inducing changes. So as to determine the relative effectiveness of such protocols and intervention plans of choice. This tiered meta-analysis of 66-population based studies, and 162-studywise groups, a clear pattern of ES being established across and within treatments. First, hypocaloric balance is necessary for changing body composition, but the effectiveness for establishing imbalance does not equate with the effectiveness for body compositional changes, or any biomarkers associated with metabolic issues. With analysis showing that there is a necessity to include exercise in combination with diet effectively elicit changes in body composition and biomarkers of metabolic issues. More importantly, the combination, resistance training (RT) was more effective than endurance training (ET) or combination of RT and ET, particularly when progressive training volume of 2-to-3 sets for 6-to-10 reps at an intensity of ≥75% 1RM, utilizing whole body and free-weight exercises, at altering body compositional measures (ES of 0.47, 0.30, and 0.40 for loss of BM, FM, and retention of FFM respectively) and reducing total cholesterol (ES = 0.85), triglycerides (ES = 0.86) and low-density lipoproteins (ES = 0.60). Additionally RT was more effective at reducing fasting insulin levels (ES = 3.5) than ET or ET and RT. Even though generally lower ES than RT, the inclusion of ET was more effective when performed at high intensity (e.g. ≥70% VO2max or HRmax for 30-minutes 3-4x's/wk), or in an interval training style than when utilizing the relatively common prescribed method of low-to-moderate (e.g., 50-70% VO2max or HRmax for at least equal time) steady state method, ES of 0.35, 0.39, and 0.13 for BM, FM, and FFM respectively. Thus indicating that focus of treatment should be on producing a large metabolic stress (as induced by RT or high levels of ET) rather than an energetic imbalance for adults who are overfat.

Emotional Regulation and Overeating Behaviors in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Maladaptive emotion regulation is negatively associated with overeating behavior in children and adolescents, with a complex relationship influenced by physiological, psychological, and social factors.

Abstract:The worldwide prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased, mostly in children and adolescents. The Emotional Eating theoretical model has proposed that the failure in emotional regulation could represent a risk factor for establishing maladaptive overeating behavior that represents an inadequate response to negative emotions and allows increasing body-weight. This systematic review investigates the relationship between overeating and both emotional regulation and emotional intelligence in childhood and adolescence, considering both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Moreover, another goal of the review is evaluating whether emotional regulation and emotional intelligence can cause overeating behaviors. The systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA-statement in the databases Medline, PsychArtcles, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences, and allows 484 records to be extracted. Twenty-six studies were selected according to inclusion (e.g., studies focused on children and adolescents without clinical conditions; groups of participants overweight or with obesity) and exclusion (e.g., studies that adopted qualitative assessment or cognitive-affective tasks to measure emotional variables; reviews, commentary, or brief reports) criteria detailed in the methods. Cross-sectional studies showed a negative association between emotional regulation and overeating behavior that was confirmed by longitudinal studies. These findings highlighted the role of maladaptive emotion regulation on overeating and being overweight. The relationship between these constructs in children and adolescents was consistent. The results indicated the complexity of this association, which would be influenced by many physiological, psychological, and social factors. These findings underline the need for further studies focused on emotion regulation in the development of overeating. They should analyze the mediation role of other variables (e.g., attachment style, peer pressure) and identify interventions to prevent and reduce worldwide overweight prevalence.

NBER WORKING PAPER SERIES UNDERSTANDING OVEREATING AND OBESITY

Number of 

Key takeaways:Economic and biological factors contribute to overeating, with food producers engineering products to stimulate the affective system, potentially encouraging overeating.

Abstract:The combination of economic and biological factors is likely to result in overeating, in the current environment of cheap and readily available food. This propensity is shown using a “dual-decision” approach where choices reflect the interaction between two parts of the brain: a “deliberative” system, operating as in standard economic models, and an “affective” system that responds rapidly to stimuli without considering long-term consequences. This framework is characterized by excess food consumption and body weight, in the sense that individuals prefer both ex-ante and ex-post to eat and weigh less than they actually do, with dieting being common but often unsuccessful or only partially successful. As in the standard model, weight will be related to prices. However, another potentially important reason for rising obesity is that food producers have incentives to engineer products to stimulate the affective system so as to encourage overeating. Data from multiple waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys are used to investigate predictions of the dual-decision model, with the evidence providing broad support for at least some irrationality in food consumption.

Overeating among adolescents: prevalence and associations with weight-related characteristics and psychological health.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating among adolescents is prevalent and associated with negative psychological experiences, including lower body satisfaction, self-esteem, and increased suicide risk.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
To assess the prevalence of overeating among adolescents and to examine associations between overeating and sociodemographic characteristics, weight status, dieting behaviors, body satisfaction, depressive mood, self-esteem, and suicide.

METHOD
A school-based sample of 4746 boys and girls in public middle and high schools in Minnesota completed the Project EAT (Eating Among Teens) survey and anthropometric measurements of height and weight.

RESULTS
Overall, 17.3% of girls and 7.8% of boys reported objective overeating in the past year. Youths who engaged in overeating were more likely to be overweight or obese, to have dieted in the past year, to be trying to lose weight currently, and to report that weight and shape are very important to their overall feelings about self. Youths who met criteria for binge eating syndrome (high frequency of objective overeating with loss of control and distress regarding the binge eating) scored significantly lower on measures of body satisfaction and self-esteem and higher on a measure of depressive mood than those who reported either subclinical or no binge eating. Overeating was associated with suicide risk; more than one fourth of girls (28.6%) and boys (27.8%) who met criteria for binge eating syndrome reported that they had attempted suicide.

CONCLUSIONS
Overeating among adolescents is associated with a number of adverse behaviors and negative psychological experiences. As the current study is cross-sectional, it is not possible to ascertain cause and effect. Future research should seek to identify whether objective overeating is an early warning sign of additional psychological distress or is a potential consequence of compromised psychological health. Clinical implications are discussed.

Psychological maladaptation of people with overeating

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating is a common and maladaptive way to manage negative emotions, and is associated with severe psychological and emotional disorders.

Abstract:Overeating is a new diagnosis in the fifth edition of the Manual of Diagnosis and Statistics of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). The prevalence of compulsive overeating is much higher than anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and other eating disorders. Overeating is characterized by recurrent episodes of overeating without compensatory behavior, such as vomiting or excessive exercise to prevent weight gain. Episodes of overeating are accompanied by feelings of loss of control, anxiety, depression or guilt, overeating is associated with severe psychological and emotional disorders, which hinders the ability to self-regulation. Several factors can affect eating behavior and stimulate food intake beyond needs. For many people, eating is used as a means to manage negative emotions. Overeating can be seen as an maladaptive way of overcoming negative emotions.

Overeating with and without loss of control: Associations with weight status, weight-related characteristics, and psychosocial health.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating, with or without loss of control, is associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors, dieting, nonsuicidal self-injury, lower body satisfaction, and self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms in adolescents.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
The relative importance of loss of control and overeating in the relationship between binge eating and eating-related and general psychopathology has been debated in the literature. This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of overeating with and without loss of control within a diverse, population-based sample of adolescents.

METHOD
A highly diverse (81.1% non-White) sample of adolescents (n = 2,793) from EAT-2010 (Eating and Activity in Teens) completed self-report questionnaires assessing eating-related psychopathology, substance use, nonsuicidal self-injury, depressive symptoms, and self-esteem.

RESULTS
Overeating without loss of control was reported by 6.9% of girls and 5.0% of boys, while 9.6% of girls and 6.3% of boys reported overeating with loss of control (binge eating). Overall, overeating (with or without loss of control) was positively associated with unhealthy or extreme weight control behaviors, dieting, nonsuicidal self-injury, lower body satisfaction, and self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms relative to no overeating. Among girls, binge eating was associated with unhealthy or extreme weight control behaviors, lower self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms relative to overeating without loss of control, while in boys, binge eating was associated with greater cigarette usage, lower body satisfaction, and greater depressive symptoms than overeating without loss of control (although cigarette usage was comparable in boys reporting binge eating and no overeating).

DISCUSSION
Any overeating, with or without loss of control, was associated with multiple adverse correlates among adolescents. Loss of control was uniquely associated with multiple health indicators, further highlighting its importance as a marker of severity of overeating.

The Association of Emotional Eating with Overweight/Obesity, Depression, Anxiety/Stress, and Dietary Patterns: A Review of the Current Clinical Evidence

Number of 

Key takeaways:Emotional eating is associated with overweight/obesity, depression, anxiety/stress, and unhealthy eating behaviors, highlighting the need for coping mechanisms and nutrition education.

Abstract:(1) Background: Emotional eating is considered as the propensity to eat in response to emotions. It is considered as a critical risk factor for recurrent weight gain. Such overeating is able to affect general health due to excess energy intake and mental health. So far, there is still considerable controversy on the effect of the emotional eating concept. The objective of this study is to summarize and evaluate the interconnections among emotional eating and overweight/obesity, depression, anxiety/stress, and dietary patterns; (2) Methods: This is a thorough review of the reported associations among emotional eating and overweight/obesity, depression, anxiety/stress, and dietary patterns. We compressively searched the most precise scientific online databases, e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar to obtain the most up-to-date data from clinical studies in humans from the last ten years (2013–2023) using critical and representative keywords. Several inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied for scrutinizing only longitudinal, cross-sectional, descriptive, and prospective clinical studies in Caucasian populations; (3) Results: The currently available findings suggest that overeating/obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors (e.g., fast food consumption) are associated with emotional eating. Moreover, the increase in depressive symptoms seems to be related with more emotional eating. Psychological distress is also related with a greater risk for emotional eating. However, the most common limitations are the small sample size and their lack of diversity. In addition, a cross-sectional study was performed in the majority of them; (4) Conclusions: Finding coping mechanisms for the negative emotions and nutrition education can prevent the prevalence of emotional eating. Future studies should further explain the underlying mechanisms of the interconnections among emotional eating and overweight/obesity, depression, anxiety/stress, and dietary patterns.

Key takeaways:Parental depression and emotional feeding practices are independently associated with overeating in preadolescence, highlighting the need to support parents' mental health and healthy feeding practices.

Abstract:Background Children’s eating behaviors, including a tendency towards overeating, are strongly influenced by the family. Children prone to overeating are at a high risk of excessive weight gain, which can lead to further adverse health outcomes. Therefore, identifying factors that contribute to overeating is crucial for promoting healthy weight development. Given the inconsistencies in previous research, mostly involving young children, we investigated the child and parental characteristics associated with overeating in preadolescence. Methods The cross-sectional study included 5,973 preadolescents aged 9–12 years from the Finnish Health in Teens (Fin-HIT) cohort. A tendency towards overeating was based on a parent-reported question. We utilized extensive parent questionnaire and Medical Birth Register data, and used ordinal and stepwise logistic regression to identify the independent determinants of overeating. Results The proportion of preadolescents with a parent-reported tendency towards overeating was 10% (n = 606). In the multivariable model, boys had higher odds of overeating (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.58) compared with girls. Preadolescents with overweight and obesity had 9- and 30-fold odds (95% CI 7.31–11.29 and 20.07–44.54, respectively) of overeating compared with healthy-weight preadolescents. Furthermore, parental depression and emotional feeding increased the odds of overeating in the preadolescent (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.08–2.02 and OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03–1.57). Conclusion Along with child weight status and sex, parental depression and emotional feeding were independently associated with overeating in preadolescence. Therefore, it is important to support parents’ mental health and their healthy feeding practices. Our findings can be targeted to manage overeating and prevent overweight in children and adolescents.

Cognitive dysfunction is a risk factor for overeating and obesity.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Cognitive dysfunction, such as deficits in attentional bias, delay discounting, and episodic memory, is linked to overeating and obesity, and new weight loss interventions should target these deficits.

Abstract:This article introduces the rapidly growing literature linking cognitive dysfunction to overeating and obesity. Though neural responses to food and food cues can predispose individuals to overeating, these processes are moderated by a series of cognitive factors. Deficits in attentional bias, delay discounting, and episodic memory have clear connections to overeating in both laboratory and real-world settings. New weight loss interventions target these deficits through strategies designed to either directly improve cognitive function or circumvent them by tailoring weight management strategies to individuals' specific cognitive profile. Future iterations of these interventions should better account for the influence of obesity-related risk factors such as poor sleep, high stress, socioeconomic burden, and prevalent medical risk factors. In so doing, future work may lead to treatment strategies that promote healthy eating and weight for a lifetime. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

Emotional eating in healthy individuals and patients with an eating disorder: evidence from psychometric, experimental and naturalistic studies

Number of 

Key takeaways:Emotional eating is a controversial concept, with mixed results in predicting actual food intake in healthy individuals and varying results in individuals with clinical forms of overeating (e.g. binge eating).

Abstract:Emotional eating has traditionally been defined as (over)eating in response to negative emotions. Such overeating can impact general health because of excess energy intake and mental health, due to the risks of developing binge eating. Yet, there is still significant controversy on the validity of the emotional eating concept and several theories compete in explaining its mechanisms. The present paper examines the emotional eating construct by reviewing and integrating recent evidence from psychometric, experimental and naturalistic research. Several psychometric questionnaires are available and some suggest that emotions differ fundamentally in how they affect eating (i.e. overeating, undereating). However, the general validity of such questionnaires in predicting actual food intake in experimental studies is questioned and other eating styles such as restrained eating seem to be better predictors of increased food intake under negative emotions. Also, naturalistic studies, involving the repeated assessment of momentary emotions and eating behaviour in daily life, are split between studies supporting and studies contradicting emotional eating in healthy individuals. Individuals with clinical forms of overeating (i.e. binge eating) consistently show positive relationships between negative emotions and eating in daily life. We will conclude with a summary of the controversies around the emotional eating construct and provide recommendations for future research and treatment development.

General Anxiety and Overeating in Undergraduate Students

Number of 

Key takeaways:General anxiety is strongly associated with disordered overeating patterns in undergraduate students, with body satisfaction negatively correlated in women.

Abstract:Existing research on the relations between anxiety and overeating is multifaceted, contradictory, and often focused on clinical, non-diverse populations. This is an exploratory study to clarify the relationship between anxiety and eating behaviors in a group of undergraduate students with a wide range of weights and mental health statuses. Specifically, this study primarily assesses relationships among general anxiety and overeating patterns. The overeating patterns assessed are binge-eating, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. This study supplements the primary research focus by adding the following variables: self-regulation, cognitive restraint, body mass index (BMI), and body satisfaction. Through an online questionnaire, 390 male and female participants aged 18-62 anonymously answered 73 questions. Results supported the study's primary hypothesis of a significant, positive relationship between overeating patterns and general anxiety in both male and female undergraduate students. In women, results fully supported the second hypothesis that body satisfaction is negatively correlated with each of the following variables: general anxiety, overeating patterns, and cognitive restraint. In men, results supported the second hypothesis except body satisfaction had no significant correlation with uncontrolled eating and cognitive restraint. The main findings paired with the additional results indicate that general anxiety is strongly associated with disordered overeating patterns. These findings add to the existing literature and may enhance public awareness surrounding the relationship between unhealthy eating patterns and mental health while providing a better understanding of obesity as it relates to anxiety.

Mood, food, and obesity

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating and obesity are linked to mood and emotions, with biological factors involving mood, food intake, and brain signaling playing a bi-directional role in obesity.

Abstract:Food is a potent natural reward and food intake is a complex process. Reward and gratification associated with food consumption leads to dopamine (DA) production, which in turn activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain. An individual will repeatedly eat a particular food to experience this positive feeling of gratification. This type of repetitive behavior of food intake leads to the activation of brain reward pathways that eventually overrides other signals of satiety and hunger. Thus, a gratification habit through a favorable food leads to overeating and morbid obesity. Overeating and obesity stems from many biological factors engaging both central and peripheral systems in a bi-directional manner involving mood and emotions. Emotional eating and altered mood can also lead to altered food choice and intake leading to overeating and obesity. Research findings from human and animal studies support a two-way link between three concepts, mood, food, and obesity. The focus of this article is to provide an overview of complex nature of food intake where various biological factors link mood, food intake, and brain signaling that engages both peripheral and central nervous system signaling pathways in a bi-directional manner in obesity.

Should overeating and obesity be classified as an addictive disorder in DSM-5?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating and obesity should be classified as an addictive disorder in the DSM-5 due to their similarity to substance dependence and their impact on public health.

Abstract:Overeating and associated obesity are major public health problems. In addition to its notable adverse health consequences, the behavior of overeating has significant neurobiological and psychological underpinnings. Current classification systems of mental disorders (DSM-IV and ICD-10) address this increasingly prevalent 'disorder' in a limited and inconsistent manner. Several similarities between overeating and substance dependence have been documented with regards to phenomenology, shared neurobiology, and treatment. This has led to suggestions that a new category of 'food addiction' be added to our psychiatric nosology and that this category be included with substance use disorders under a broad rubric of 'addiction disorders'. In this article, we consider the rationale for this recommendation and evaluate its pros and cons. We summarize how the problem of overeating is addressed in our current classification systems and discuss DSM-5 approaches to the issue.

The concept of 'food addiction' helps inform the understanding of overeating and obesity: NO.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Food addiction is a simplistic concept that does not fully understand overeating and obesity, and may distract from addressing environmental factors to combat the obesity pandemic.

Abstract:Overeating is a complex behavioral phenotype in terms of both physiology and psychology. The mere transference of the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders to define food addiction is too simplistic, for the following reasons: 1) a range of somatic and mental disorders require exclusion; 2) food addiction requires distinction from the physiological need to ingest sufficient calories to maintain a high body weight; 3) intentional weight loss can induce an eating behavior mimicking food addiction; 4) the concept lacks validation, especially in light of the high prevalence of 'food addiction' in patients with anorexia nervosa; and 5) this construct has not led to novel and successful treatments for overeating and obesity. The concept of food addiction has the potential to distract from the need for focus on environmental influencers to combat the obesity pandemic.

The Impact of Obesity on the Cardiovascular System

Number of 

Key takeaways:Obesity increases cardiovascular risk and leads to structural and functional changes in the heart, but also has a protective effect, with improved cardiac imaging techniques allowing early detection and treatment of subclinical conditions.

Abstract:Obesity is a growing health problem worldwide. It is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk on the one hand of obesity itself and on the other hand of associated medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, insulin resistance, and sleep apnoea syndrome). Obesity has an important role in atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Obesity leads to structural and functional changes of the heart, which causes heart failure. The altered myocardial structure increases the risk of atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. However, obesity also has a protective effect on the clinical outcome of underlying cardiovascular disease, the phenomenon called obesity paradox. The improved cardiac imaging techniques allow the early detection of altered structure and function of the heart in obese patients. In this review, we attempt to summarize the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular diseases and outline the underlying mechanisms. The demonstrated new techniques of cardiac diagnostic procedures allow for the early detection and treatment of subclinical medical conditions and, therefore, the prevention of cardiovascular events.

Obesity and Mechanisms of its Negative Impact on the Cardiovascular System

Number of 

Key takeaways:Obesity negatively impacts the heart and blood vessels, leading to the development of cardiovascular diseases and contributing to risk factors for hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

Abstract:Currently, the number of obese people in the world is constantly increasing. Obesity has a direct negative impact on the heart and blood vessels, which can be considered not only as an appropriate response to an increase in the volume of circulating blood due to an increase in body weight, but also as a side tissue reaction of the myocardium to hormonal and metabolic changes inherent in obesity. Our review is devoted to the description of the mechanisms of influence of obesity on the structural and functional parameters of the heart, which create prerequisites for the development of cardiovascular diseases, as well as the existing contradictions. Currently, the accumulated data suggest that an excessive amount of adipose tissue, in addition to metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, imbalance of adipokines and inflammation markers, leading to the development of lipotoxicity, can directly penetrate the myocardium and cause violations of its contractile properties, as well as affect the conduction of excitation pulses and provoke the development of rhythm and conduction disorders. The development of endothelial dysfunction in obesity ultimately leads to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. In addition, obesity contributes to the emergence of risk factors for hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Given the differences in the literature on the effect of obesity on long-term outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases, it is important to conduct prospective studies on the role of individual factors and their combinations that affect the mortality of patients with cardiovascular diseases.

Late-Night Overeating or Low-Quality Food Choices Late at Night Are Associated with Subclinical Vascular Damage in Patients at Increased Cardiovascular Risk

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late-night overeating and poor-quality food choices are associated with subclinical vascular damage in individuals at increased cardiovascular risk.

Abstract:Late-night overeating (LNO) is associated with several cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Limited data exist regarding the association between late-night (LN) systematic food consumption, LNO, and LN poor food quality with subclinical vascular damage (SVD) which precedes the onset of CVD. This study aimed to investigate the above associations with SVD in a large sample of adults, free of established CVD, with one or more CVD risk factors. In total, 901 adults (45.2% males) underwent anthropometric, dietary (through two 24 h dietary recalls) and vascular assessment. LN systematic eating was defined as consumption of food after 19:00 h in both dietary recalls and LNO was defined as systematic consumption of >40% of daily total energy intake (dTEI) after 19:00 h. Systematic LN food consumption was inversely associated with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (−1.44 95% C.I. (−2.76, −0.12)) after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, BMI and dTEI. LNO was positively associated with existence of carotid plaques (1.70 95% C.I. (1.07, 2.68)), while LN increased consumption of red meat, refined grains and wine and low consumption of whole wheat grains was positively associated with Aix (Augmentation Index) (0.84 95% C.I. (0.09, 1.59)), after adjusting for all the mentioned confounders. Systematic LN eating is associated with lower DBP while systematic LNO and consumption of poor-quality food late at night, is associated with SVD. Further research is needed to define more accurately the impact of LN eating habits on vascular health.

Late-Night Overeating and All-Cause and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality in Adults Aged ≥ 50: A Cohort Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late-night overeating is an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in adults aged 50 and older, with varying effects depending on age, sex, alcohol consumption, and hypertension.

Abstract:Late-night overeating (LNOE) is closely associated with many health risk factors, but whether LNOE can increase the risk of death remains unknown. Thus, the prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the relationship between LNOE and mortality using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 11,893 participants aged 50 years and older were included in the study. Dietary information was obtained through 24-h dietary recall interviews. Cox regression, subgroup, sensitivity, and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to assess the association between LNOE and mortality. During a median follow-up of 8.3 years, 2,498 deaths occurred. After adjusting for major confounders, compared to the non-late-night eating (NLNE) group, the LNOE group was associated with higher risks of all-cause (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.06–2.04) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (HR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.13–3.60). No significant association was found between late-night eating (LNE) and mortality. Subgroup analyses showed that the LNOE group had a greater risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in participants older than 70 years, with alcohol consumption and hypertension and demonstrated an increased risk of all-cause mortality in males and higher CVD mortality in females. The habit of LNOE was an independent risk factor for all-cause and CVD mortality in US adults aged 50 years and older, which was also influenced by age, sex, alcohol consumption, and hypertension.

Adolescent overeating and binge eating behavior in relation to subsequent cardiometabolic risk outcomes: a prospective cohort study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating and binge eating behavior in adolescents are associated with higher markers of heart disease and diabetes risk, but these associations are only partially explained by higher baseline weight.

Abstract:Binge eating disorder is bidirectionally associated with obesity and with metabolic syndrome. It is less clear whether overeating and binge eating, or overeating with loss of control, also predicts metabolic risk, and if so, whether these associations are solely attributable to greater weight. The goal of this study was to examine longitudinal associations of overeating and binge eating behavior with cardiometabolic risk markers in adolescence.Adolescents (n = 619) in the Project Viva research study self-reported overeating and binge eating behavior in early adolescence (median 12.9 years, 'baseline'). In late adolescence (median 17.4 years, 'follow-up'), we assessed outcomes of adiposity and blood pressure, and in a subset of participants (n = 270-424), biomarkers of dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, liver dysfunction, inflammation, and adipokine homeostasis. We conducted multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for socio-demographics and prenatal obesogenic exposures, and additionally for baseline body mass index (BMI) z-score.At baseline, 58 (9%) participants reported overeating behavior, and of those, 24 (41%) had binge eating behavior (e.g., overeating accompanied by loss of control). In adjusted models, adolescents with overeating had higher adiposity at follow-up ~ 5 years later (e.g., % body fat 4.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.76, 6.31) than those not reporting overeating behavior; additional adjustment for baseline BMI z-score attenuated associations generally except for % body fat (2.95; 95% CI 1.03, 4.87). Overeating behavior was also associated with higher inflammation and greater adipokine dysfunction, remaining positively associated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) (log-transformed β = 0.42 pg/mL; 95% CI 0.12, 0.73) and negatively with adiponectin (log-transformed β = -0.28 ug/mL; 95% CI - 0.47, - 0.08) even after adjusting for baseline BMI z-score. Overeating behavior was not consistently associated with other outcomes. Adolescents reporting binge eating behavior generally had the greatest adiposity, (e.g., % body fat 5.00; 95% CI 1.74, 8.25) as compared to those without overeating.Adolescents reporting overeating and binge eating behavior had higher adiposity and poorer inflammatory and adipokine profiles, but no difference in other outcomes, than adolescents who did not endorse these behaviors. These associations were only partially accounted for by higher baseline BMI z-score. These differences may signal increased risk for future cardiovascular disease.We examined associations of overeating and binge eating behavior risk markers for future heart disease and diabetes. Adolescents (n = 619) in the Project Viva research study self-reported overeating and binge eating behavior on questionnaires completed in early adolescence (~ 13 years, “baseline”). In late adolescence (~ 17 years, “follow-up”), we collected research measures of body fat and blood pressure, and in a subset of participants, blood levels of cholesterol, fat-related hormones, liver dysfunction, and inflammation. We applied analytic methods to adjust for socio-demographics and to better understand how baseline weight could explain the associations. At baseline, 58 (9%) participants reported overeating behavior, and of those, 24 (41%) had binge eating behavior (e.g., overeating behavior accompanied by feeling loss of control). We found that adolescents reporting overeating behavior had higher later body fat and poorer inflammatory and fat hormone concentrations than those who did not report overeating. These associations were only partially explained by the fact that those with overeating also had higher baseline weight. Other markers of cardiometabolic risk in late adolescence were not different among those with or without overeating. Overall, our study suggests that overeating and binge eating behavior are associated with some higher markers of heart disease and diabetes risk.

Relationship between anxiety, depressive symptoms and compulsive overeating disorder in patients with cardiovascular diseases

Number of 

Key takeaways:Compulsive overeating disorder is present in 18% of patients with cardiovascular diseases and is associated with high BMI and anxiety, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation and mental health programs.

Abstract:ABSTRACT Objectives: to identify the presence of compulsive overeating disorder in patients with cardiovascular diseases and to verify its relation with sociodemographic, clinical variables and the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method: cross-sectional, correlational study with a sample of 111 patients with cardiovascular diseases. The presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale instrument and compulsive overeating disorder was assessed through a likert instrument called the Periodic Eating Disorder Scale (Binge Eating Scale). Results: there was a predominance of patients without compulsive overeating disorder (n=91, 82%), followed by moderated compulsive overeating (n=15, 13.5%) and severe (n=5, 4.5%) associating to high levels of body mass index (p=0.010) and the presence of anxiety (p=0.017). Conclusion: Compulsive overeating disorder was present in 18% of the patients, being associated with body mass index and anxiety, suggesting that health professionals should pay attention to the comprehensive evaluation of patients with cardiovascular diseases. Important results emerged from this study, emphasizing the need to implement programs to improve the patients’ mental and physical health in both primary and specialized care services.

Releasing the brake on eating

Number of 

Key takeaways:Obesity alters neuronal gene expression and activity in the lateral hypothalamic area, potentially explaining overeating and contributing to other diseases.

Abstract:Obesity alters neuronal gene expression and activity that may influence overeating Obesity is a global health problem that contributes to the increased incidence of other diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Overeating is the largest determinant of obesity (1), yet we understand very little of the neural mechanisms underlying why individuals continue to consume food regardless of satiety. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) is a key region of the brain that coordinates diverse physiological functions related to survival—including responses to stress, drinking, and energy homeostasis, in order to maintain a physiological equilibrium in a changing environment. The LHA receives a variety of peripheral inputs about current energy needs and integrates these with centrally provided information to coordinate behavior. On page 1271 of this issue, Rossi et al. (2) demonstrate how glutamatergic neurons of the LHA respond to an obesogenic diet of high-fat chow, potentially explaining overeating.

Abstract:Overeating, sometimes considered as eating disorder, is excessive intake of food by a person when compared with the energy needed. It is not a disease but extra consumption of food than required consequently leads to extra caloric intake which may gain weight and increase the risk for chronic diseases related to being overweight like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart diseases and stroke .

Association between Eating Patterns and Quality of Life in Patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with a lower quality of life, particularly in physical and mental aspects.

Abstract:(1) Background: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disease that has autosomal dominant inheritance, being characterized by increased levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) due to a decreased clearance of the circulant LDLs. Alimentation is a key factor in patients with FH. Implementing a restrictive diet may have a significant impact on their quality of life, besides the social and environmental factors. (2) Methods: We realized a prospective study that was conducted in the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Clinic from the Clinical Rehabilitation Hospital and that included 70 patients with FH and 20 controls (adults with no comorbidities). We evaluated their lipid profile, their quality of life through the Short Form—36 Questionnaire, and their eating habits. (3) Results: Lower scores in the quality-of-life questionnaire were obtained in the FH group both in the case of the physical (73.06 vs. 87.62) and the mental component (75.95 vs. 83.10). Women had better physical function (85 vs. 75) and physical role than men (100 vs. 75). The group aged over 65 has the score lowest for all 10 components. Overeating was driven by boredom and was more frequent on weekends in the FH group. None of the patients in the control group felt loneliness or depression associated with overeating. (4) Conclusions: Overeating in patients with FH is associated with a lower quality of life. The complexity of these patients needs a multidisciplinary approach. Thus, the quality-of-life questionnaire should be implemented in their periodic follow-ups in order to increase their general status, paying special attention to geriatric patients.

Short and Long term effects of Overeating (Atimatrashan) on health and well-being: A Conceptual Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Habitual overeating leads to obesity, which in turn predisposes to various diseases, including Metabolic syndrome and Cancer.

Abstract:Overeating is the excess food consumed in relation to the energy that an organism expends. Out of various eating disorders overeating from supersize meal portions is termed as Atimatrashan in Ayurveda. In Ayurveda great emphasis has been given on the ideal quantity i.e., ‘matra’ of Aahara which is customized according to individual appetite. While occasional overeating predisposes to various disorders manifested through impaired digestive function, Habitual overeating eventually leads to obesity. Obesity being a state of chronic inflammation predisposes to wide range of diseases including Metabolic syndrome and Cancer. In this context, this paper discusses the Ayurvedic concept of Tridosha Prakop (vitiation of all the three Doshas) with the resulting ailments and Aamvish which is said to be formed as a result of habitual overeating and is thought to be Vishsadrushya (highly toxic) and param asaadhyam (incurable).
