Negative impact of irregular daily rhythm on health

Irregularity in daily rhythm, especially regarding sleep, meals, and work, has a clearly negative impact on health. Disruptions of the circadian rhythm, irregular meals, and lack of fixed sleep hours are associated with a range of negative health effects, including increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic disorders, and mental health problems. Regularity in daily activities is crucial for maintaining optimal health.

Level of evidence:Preliminary

Lack of daily routine leads to a disruption of the body's natural circadian rhythm, which negatively affects metabolic processes and the regulation of hormones such as leptin and ghrelin that control appetite. Additionally, irregular sleep and meal times result in poorer glycemic control, reduced metabolic rate, and increased risk of weight gain and insulin resistance. Irregularity at work, especially shift work, causes so-called 'social jetlag', which worsens metabolic parameters, including cholesterol levels and risk of heart disease.

Lack of regularity in daily rhythm, including irregular meals, sleep, and work, has a documented negative impact on health. Lack of a stable routine leads to health problems such as metabolic disorders, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and also mental health disorders. Regularity in daily life, especially regarding sleep and meals, is key to maintaining health.

Lack of regularity in daily rhythms affects many people worldwide, especially due to shift work, irregular sleep and eating times, and time management problems. The scale of the problem may increase, given the growing number of people working irregular hours or in occupations requiring circadian rhythm changes.

Establish a regular sleep schedule

Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to stabilize your circadian rhythm.

Eat meals at fixed times, ideally every 3-4 hours, to support your metabolism and control appetite.

Try to have your last meal at least 2-3 hours before bedtime to improve sleep quality and aid digestion.

Avoid shift work if possible

Employment during regular hours will help stabilize your daily rhythm and metabolic health. If you must work shifts, try to maintain regular sleep during the remaining hours.

Regular physical activity, preferably at the same time of day, will help improve sleep quality and metabolic health.

Lack of daily routine, that is, irregular meal, sleep, and work times, is clearly linked to worsening mental health. Regularity of daily activities, such as sleep, eating, physical activity, and social contacts, supports better mental well-being and lowers the risk of symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress.

Impact of irregularity on mental health

Key areas of routine and mental health

Lack of daily routine – irregular meal, sleep, and work times – has a clearly negative impact on metabolism. Disruptions of the circadian rhythm, irregular eating, and insufficient sleep increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic disorders.

Mechanisms and Effects

Lack of daily routine, meaning irregular meal, sleep, and work times, clearly negatively impacts sleep quality and duration. Regularity in daily habits, especially sleep and meals, is crucial for healthy sleep and overall well-being.

Latent Profiles and Transitions of Daily Routine Disruptions Are Associated with Severity of Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression

Number of 

Key takeaways:During the pandemic, maintaining regular exercise, socializing, and leisure during the acute phase reduced psychiatric symptoms.

Abstract:In this prospective study, we identified different patterns of daily routine disruptions and investigated their associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms between 2020 and 2021. A population-representative sample (N = 671) was assessed at the acute phase of the pandemic (April–July 2020, T1) and again at 1-year follow-up (April–August 2021, T2). Daily routine disruptions denoted perceived disruptions to regular exercising, socializing, and leisure. We found that respondents who could sustain regular exercising, socializing, and leisure showed the lowest levels of psychiatric symptoms at T1. Respondents reporting disruptions to these routines had the highest levels of psychiatric symptoms at T2. Respondents who could sustain or enhance the regularity of these routines between T1 and T2 reported less mental health problems than those with persistent or increased disruptions. We discussed interventions and strategies to sustain socializing and leisure for promoting public mental health during large-scale disasters.

Regularizing daily routines for mental health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regularizing daily routines during and after the COVID-19 pandemic can improve mental health and reduce stress during acute stress.

Abstract:activities, and practices associated with work or study, including keeping oneself on time and meeting goals and targets. During a pandemic, some routines are disrupted as a result of stress (eg, sleep) while other disruptions result from economic factors (eg, work activities). Routines are often terminated due to other contextual restrictions, for example, face-to-face interactions with relatives, friends, or coworkers. With our multitude of daily activities, disruption and termination can often co-occur. Because primary routines regularize the overall structure of daily living, disruption and termination of primary routines have a more pivotal role in mental health during acute stress .

Daily routines, parent-child conflict, and psychological maladjustment among Chinese children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Maintaining regular daily routines during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for children's and adolescents' mental health, with stronger associations in boys and primary school children.

Abstract:Family lives have been changed dramatically due to the stay-at-home orders implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. A variety of factors serve to increase the risk for children and adolescents in developing mental health issues during the prolonged stay-at-home period. The primary aim of this study was to examine a complex conceptual model linking daily routines, parent-child conflict, and indices of psychological maladjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of Chinese children and adolescents. Participants were N = 1,594 children and adolescents (50.6% girls; Mage = 13.13, SDage = 1.54) and their mothers, from Zhengzhou in Mainland China. Multisource assessments include youth self-reports of loneliness, depressive symptoms, and perceived conflict with parents during the stay-at-home period, as well as maternal reports of their child's daily routines during this time. Among the results, parent-child conflict mediated the relations between daily routines and indices of psychological maladjustment, such that a lack of routine predicted greater parent-child conflict, which in turn was associated with higher levels of loneliness and symptoms of depression. Further, results from multiple group analyses revealed that associations between daily routines and maladjustment were stronger among boys than girls-as well as stronger among primary school children than middle school adolescents. Findings highlighted the importance of maintaining regular routines for children's and adolescents' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key takeaways:Maintaining behavioral routines during times of hardship, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can help alleviate the negative impact on mental health.

Abstract:ABSTRACT Among the public health recommendations for supporting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, many strategies had an impact on biological rhythms, like sleep hygiene, physical exercise and healthy eating habits. Considering the known relationship between circadian organization and mental health, our aim was to test the association between behavioral regularity and mental health, and its interaction with chronotype, in a large sample surveyed in Brazil. We collected longitudinal data using online questionnaires that assessed sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral routines, mental health (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5 scales), and chronotype estimation based on midpoint of sleep on free days – MSF (μMCTQ), in a sample of 1390 participants (81% females). We computed a Routine Regularity Score (RRS) that reflects regularity across four behaviors: sleep, eating, working, exercising. There was a strong negative association between RRS and the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms (GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores), which was weaker among participants with late MSF, and a strong positive association with well-being (WHO-5 scores). RRS was a mediator of the MSF-mental health association and a predictor of mental health states. This study provides empirical evidence that maintaining behavioral routines during times of hardship may serve as tools to alleviate the negative impact on mental health.

Key takeaways:Regularity of diverse daily routines and ability to maintain routines during stress are associated with reduced PTSD symptoms.

Abstract:ABSTRACT Background: Previous research has highlighted the importance of regularizing daily routines for maintaining mental health. Little is known about whether and how regularity of daily routines is associated with reduced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Objective: We aimed to examine the associations between regularity of daily routines and PTSD symptoms in two studies (N = 796). Method: In Study 1, prospective data were analysed with the latent change score model to investigate the association between sustainment of regular daily routines and change in PTSD symptoms over time amid massive civil unrest in Hong Kong in 2019. Study 2 used vignette as a quasi-experimental method to assess the ability of maintaining regular daily routines in face of a major stressor, and tested its associations with PTSD symptoms. Results: In Study 1, increased regularity of diverse daily routines was inversely associated with increased PTSD symptoms amid the civil unrest in Hong Kong (β = −.427 to −.224, 95% confidence intervals , p values < .01). In Study 2, a greater ability to maintain regular daily routines during stress was associated with lower levels of PTSD symptoms (β = −.285 to −.096, 95% confidence intervals , p values < .05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest the benefit of considering diverse everyday activities in evaluating PTSD symptoms in both clinical and subclinical populations. Interventions with the direct focus on the role of daily living could promote psychological resilience during and after potentially traumatic events. HIGHLIGHTS Increased regularity of routines (hygiene, healthy eating, sleep, duties at home, exercising, leisure and social activities, work/study involvement) was related to less increase in PTSD symptoms amid widespread civil unrest. The ability to maintain regular routines during stress was inversely associated with PTSD symptoms. Research and interventions with the direct focus on the role of daily living could promote psychological resilience during and after potentially traumatic events.

Measuring everyday processes and mechanisms of stress resilience: Development and initial validation of the Sustainability of Living Inventory (SOLI).

Number of 

Key takeaways:The Sustainability of Living Inventory (SOLI) effectively measures daily routine sustainment and its impact on stress resilience, with potential implications for mental health screening and intervention.

Abstract:Sustainment of daily routines requires greater psychological resilience and may lead to greater resilience in the face of stressors. Existing scales tend only to focus on emotions and engagement, rather than how well individuals sustain routine behaviors. To address this gap in the literature, we developed the Sustainability of Living Inventory (SOLI). A pool of 46 Likert-type items were developed to indicate how regularly respondents performed a variety of specific routines. Four separate study samples were collected through online surveys with community-dwelling American adults (N = 1,109). The final model evidenced excellent goodness-of-fit and consisted of 42 items, which loaded on eight dimensions: hygiene, eating, sleep, duties at home, leisure at home, exercising, social activities, and work/study involvement (α = .73-.93). These eight dimensions further loaded on two second-order factors, primary and secondary daily routines. Convergent validity was demonstrated in the correlations with Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma Scale, Savoring Beliefs Inventory, and Conservation of Resources-Evaluation. Discriminant validity was demonstrated in the correlations with the List of Threatening Experiences, Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, and items on chronic financial strain. Criterion-related validity was demonstrated in the correlations with established outcome measures including State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Incremental validity was shown in the correlations with outcome measures independent of common coping and resource variables. Implications of the SOLI on mental health screening and intervention were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

Consequences of Routine Work-Schedule Instability for Worker Health and Well-Being

Number of 

Key takeaways:Routine work-schedule instability is strongly associated with psychological distress, poor sleep quality, and unhappiness, with work-life conflict being a key social determinant of well-being.

Abstract:Research on precarious work and its consequences overwhelmingly focuses on the economic dimension of precarity, epitomized by low wages. But the rise in precarious work also involves a major shift in its temporal dimension, such that many workers now experience routine instability in their work schedules. This temporal instability represents a fundamental and under-appreciated manifestation of the risk shift from firms to workers. A lack of suitable existing data, however, has precluded investigation of how precarious scheduling practices affect workers’ health and well-being. We use an innovative approach to collect survey data from a large and strategically selected segment of the U.S. workforce: hourly workers in the service sector. These data reveal that exposure to routine instability in work schedules is associated with psychological distress, poor sleep quality, and unhappiness. Low wages are also associated with these outcomes, but unstable and unpredictable schedules are much more strongly associated. Precarious schedules affect worker well-being in part through the mediating influence of household economic insecurity, yet a much larger proportion of the association is driven by work-life conflict. The temporal dimension of work is central to the experience of precarity and an important social determinant of well-being.

Association between healthy lifestyle choices and mental health among students: a cross sectional study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Poor mental health among college students is linked to factors like lack of health knowledge, physical exercise, irregular schedules, and chronic smoking.

Abstract:The prevalence of mental health problems among college students, both domestically and internationally, has emerged as a significant public health concern. College students are in a period of transition to independent living. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can have advantageous effects on their overall well-being. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the impact of healthy lifestyle choices on mental health problems among college students in China. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of college students from 2021 to 2023 at a university in Wuhan (N = 1826) using the cluster sampling method. We employed Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression to evaluate the association between healthy lifestyle choices and mental health and identify other influencing factors. A total of 969 (53.1%) students met standard criteria for poor mental health. Multiple analysis revealed that personal characteristics including female (1.280), obesity (2.015), general or poor health status (1.738; 4.265), occasionally attending health knowledge lectures or paying attention to health books and information (1.376), healthy lifestyle choices including occasionally or seldom eating breakfast (1.393; 1.825), occasionally or seldom getting enough sleep (2.800; 3.544), a poor or very poor irregular schedule (1.792; 3.619), seldom or no physical exercise (1.395; 1.377), and often smoking (3.320) were identified as significant predictors of poor mental health. The prevalence of poor mental health among college students was high. A few types of healthy lifestyles, such as a lack of health knowledge and physical exercise, seldom eating breakfast, not getting enough sleep, an irregular schedule, and chronic smoking were closely related to abnormal psychological health symptoms. Interventions such as health education knowledge lectures and regular exercise programs should be given to college students to improve their mental health.

Regulatory Flexibility of Sustaining Daily Routines and Mental Health in Adaptation to Financial Strain: A Vignette Approach

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regulatory flexibility in sustaining daily routines is linked to better mental health, especially at higher levels of financial strain, and could guide behavioral interventions for mental health issues.

Abstract:A vignette approach was adopted to investigate flexibility of sustaining daily routines and whether and how this ability was related to mental health at different levels of financial strain. Three separate studies were conducted with community-dwelling adults (N = 1685) in the USA. In Study 1, we drafted, tested, and modified vignettes with reference to pilot data on the relevance of the scenarios and response options. In Study 2, regulatory flexibility of sustaining daily routines, as calculated in term of context sensitivity and responsiveness to feedback, was formulated correlations with self-reported instruments to demonstrate its concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity. In Study 3, path analysis examined the associations of regulatory flexibility of sustaining daily routines with psychological distress and well-being, and the moderating effects of subjective financial strain on the associations. Results showed that the inverse associations of context sensitivity and responsiveness to feedback with depressive symptoms were stronger at medium/high levels relative to lower levels of perceived financial strain. The inverse association between context sensitivity and positive affect was significant only at higher levels of strain. Our findings could provide a feasible direction for developing scalable behavioral interventions for potential mental health problems, especially among those with a lower socioeconomic status.

Routineness of Social Interactions Is Associated With Higher Affective Well-Being in Older Adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Routine social interactions in older adults are associated with higher positive affect and lower negative affect, but not with life satisfaction or cognitive abilities.

Abstract:Abstract Objectives Some research conceptualizes routineness of daily life as an indicator of cognitive vulnerability that would lead to lower well-being in older age, whereas other research expects routineness to give rise to more meaning and stability in life and thus to higher well-being. Further research is needed to understand routineness in older adults in relation to cognitive abilities and well-being. This study examined routineness of social interactions. Methods We examined data from an event-contingent experience sampling study with 103 Swiss community-dwelling older adults (aged 65 to 84 years). Participants completed in-lab cognitive assessments (reasoning, episodic memory, speed, and vocabulary) and reported their well-being (positive affect, negative affect, and life satisfaction). For more than 21 days, participants reported the time and context of their social interactions (including modality, partner type, and location). Routineness of social interactions was defined as social interactions that occurred at the same time of day over the study period. It was calculated using recurrence quantification analysis. Results Linear regressions showed that higher routineness of social interaction in general, of social interaction through the same modality, and of social interaction with the same partner type were associated with higher positive affect. Higher routineness of social interaction in general was associated with lower negative affect. Routineness of social interactions was not associated with life satisfaction or cognitive abilities. Discussion A routine social life may increase older adults’ affective well-being. Results are discussed in the context of activity engagement and time use in older age.

The Wear and Tear of Daily Stressors on Mental Health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Daily negative affect and heightened affective reactivity to stressors predict greater general affective distress and an increased likelihood of reporting an affective disorder 10 years later.

Abstract:Researchers assert that affective responses to seemingly minor daily events have long-term implications for mental health, yet this phenomenon has rarely been investigated. In the current study, we examined how levels of daily negative affect and affective reactivity in response to daily stressors predicted general affective distress and self-reported anxiety and depressive disorders 10 years after they were first assessed. Across eight consecutive evenings, participants (N = 711; age = 25 to 74 years) reported their daily stressors and their daily negative affect. Increased levels of negative affect on nonstressor days were related to general affective distress and symptoms of an affective disorder 10 years later. Heightened affective reactivity to daily stressors predicted greater general affective distress and an increased likelihood of reporting an affective disorder. These findings suggest that the average levels of negative affect that people experience and how they respond to seemingly minor events in their daily lives have long-term implications for their mental health.

Effect of regular physical activities and daytime nap intervention on enhancing mental health and self-esteem in healthy participants

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regular physical activities and short daytime naps significantly improve mental health and self-esteem in healthy individuals.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity and proper rest play a significant role in the quality of life of every individual. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of physical activities and daytime naps on mental health and self-esteem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pretest and posttest study design was selected with 95 participants who were randomly assigned to two groups. Forty-five participants were part of the interventional group, whereas 50 participants were assigned to the control group. The interventional group participated in physical activities and took a short nap of less than 20 min per day three times a week for 12 weeks. Meanwhile, control group participants were free to do daily activities without participating in any sports activity. Participants’ mental health and self-esteem were measured before and after 12 weeks. Data were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann–Whitney U test. RESULT: The results showed no significant difference between pre-and post-test in mental health (P = 0.072) and self-esteem (P = 0.061) for the control group, whereas the interventional group showed a significant difference between pre-and post-test for mental health (P ≤ 0.001) and self-esteem (P ≤ 0.001), and mean scores for mental health (59.16 ± 10.43) and self-esteem (25.62 ± 3.35) were higher than pretest (55.00 ± 11.68) (22.93 ± 1.80) scores. Mental health and self-esteem improved in the interventional group when compared with the control group after 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: The findings revealed that the interventional group had significantly higher mental health and self-esteem than the control group. Physical activities may improve mental health, self-esteem, and overall wellness. To obtain these benefits and preserve a quality of life, daily physical exercises and mandatory rest are necessary. Therefore, policymakers should prioritize these interventions to promote the overall health of such populations.

Mental Health and Productivity Among Students

Number of 

Key takeaways:Poor mental health, anxiety, depression, and lifestyle choices like poor sleep, high screen time, and lack of physical activity negatively impact student productivity and academic performance.

Abstract:Abstract— In recent years, the mental health of students has emerged as a critical concern affecting academic performance, motivation, and overall productivity. The pressures of academic workloads, social expectations, and lifestyle choices contribute significantly to students' psychological well-being. This research paper explores the intricate relationship between mental health, lifestyle factors, and productivity among students using machine learning techniques. The primary objective of the study is to uncover patterns and correlations that may inform early intervention strategies and promote healthier academic environments.

A comprehensive dataset was collected through surveys, incorporating various attributes such as sleep duration, screen time, physical activity, dietary habits, stress levels, anxiety indicators, study hours, and academic performance. Data preprocessing techniques were applied to clean and normalize the dataset. Several machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, were implemented to identify the most significant factors impacting productivity and mental health.

The study found strong correlations between mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression and lower levels of academic performance and daily productivity. Lifestyle choices like poor sleep, high screen time, and lack of physical activity were found to be major contributors to mental fatigue and reduced academic efficiency. Feature importance analysis highlighted that mental health scores, sleep patterns, and stress levels were among the most influential predictors of student productivity.

The findings underscore the need for targeted mental health interventions and awareness programs within educational institutions. By leveraging machine learning for predictive analysis, this study offers a data-driven approach to understanding student well-being and optimizing academic outcomes. This research contributes to the growing field of educational data science and emphasizes the importance of mental health in academic success.

Factors related to quality of life in community-dwelling adults in Sleman Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia: Results from a cross-sectional study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Quality of life in Indonesian community-dwelling adults is associated with daily activities, absence of chronic diseases, and depression.

Abstract:Background Quality of life studies in low- and middle-income countries have demonstrated the influence of socioeconomic factors on the quality of life (QoL). However, further studies are required to confirm this association in developing countries with rapidly ageing populations. Using Ferrans et al.’s QoL model, this study aimed to identify the factors associated with the QoL of community-dwelling adults in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study among 546 community-dwelling adults aged 50+ years was conducted in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2018. QoL was measured using the Short Form 12 questionnaire, which consists of a summary of physical and mental health. We performed stepwise logistic regression analyses to determine odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and examined the association between the QoL (physical and mental health) and demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, financial management behaviour, multimorbidity status, nutritional status, cognitive impairment status, depression status, and independence. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results Among the respondents, 15% reported poor physical health, and 9.2% reported poor mental health. Good physical health was significantly associated with the absence of chronic disease (OR 2.39; 95% CI: 1.07–5.33), independence in activities of daily living (OR 3.90; 95% CI 1.57–9.67) and instrumental activities of daily living (OR 4.34; 95% CI 2.28–8.26). Absence of depression was significantly associated with good mental health (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.3–5.96). Conclusion The QoL of community-dwelling adults in Indonesia is associated with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, as well as the absence of chronic disease and depression. Efforts should be made to prevent chronic disease and delay functional decline through healthy lifestyles and routine physical and mental health screenings.

Impact of Daily Life Factors on Physical and Mental Health

Number of 

Key takeaways:A healthy lifestyle, including consistent physical exercise, a well-rounded diet, sufficient rest, and stress control, can significantly improve mental well-being and reduce the risk of mental health issues.

Abstract:Research regularly shows the significant influence of lifestyle selections on mental well-being. Embracing a healthy lifestyle can result in significant advantages such as less stress, improved mood, and general well-being improvements. An integrated strategy involving consistent physical exercise, a well-rounded diet, sufficient rest, and successful stress control is very impactful. Participating in physical activity stimulates the secretion of endorphins and other neurotransmitters that reduce stress and improve mood. A balanced diet with key nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, dietary fiber, water, phytonutrients, and antioxidants can help prevent and manage mental health conditions. Morbid lifestyle choices including smoking, excess liquor consumption, and a poor diet can greatly increase the risk of mental health issues. Smoking not only endangers physical health but also increases the likelihood of sadness and anxiety by negatively affecting neurotransmitter regulation. Overconsumption of alcohol can disturb the intricate equilibrium of brain chemistry, which may result in illnesses such as alcohol-induced sadness and anxiety. A diet rich in processed foods, and heavy in sugar and saturated fats, lacks the vital elements needed for healthy brain function and emotional well-being, making individuals more susceptible to mood disorders. This research paper explores the complex connection between lifestyle choices and mental health, highlighting the crucial impact of these choices on psychological well-being. This study reveals through extensive empirical evidence the significant capacity of lifestyle changes to alleviate the impact of mental health problems on society. It emphasizes the crucial need for public health programs and personal behavior modifications to prioritize and encourage healthy lifestyle decisions as a fundamental aspect of mental health and overall quality of life for everyone.

Mental health and wellness

Number of 

Key takeaways:Mental health and well-being in athletes faces significant barriers due to stigma, disgrace, shame, and public disapproval, despite the growing interest in the topic.

Abstract:The World Health Organization articulated a perspective of mental health and well-being globally that acknowledged that life can be stressful but recognized the potential in every human being to respond adaptively to life's inevitable ups and downs while moving forward productively and with purpose. Despite the apparent spike in interest over the last 2 years relative to the mental health and well-being of athletes, the topic of mental health and wellness within athletic communities is not a new area of investigative inquiry. Stigma, disgrace, shame, and public disapproval represent significant roadblocks to addressing mental health and well-being challenges, irrespective of an athlete's domestic or international origin. Male athletes, on the other hand, meeting the diagnostic criteria for anger, necessitating consideration of anger management as an intervention, might, more accurately, be experiencing depression.

Meal irregularity and cardiometabolic consequences: results from observational and intervention studies

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eating meals regularly is associated with reduced cardiometabolic risk factors, but more large-scale studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Abstract:Studying irregular meal patterns fits in with the latest research focusing not only on what people eat but also when they eat, also called chrono-nutrition. Chrono-nutrition involves studying the impact of nutrition on metabolism via circadian patterns, including three aspects of time: (ir)regularity, frequency and clock time. The present paper aimed to narratively review research on irregular meal patterns and cardiometabolic consequences. Only few cross-sectional studies and prospective cohort studies were identified, and most of these suggested that eating meals irregularly is associated with a higher risk of the metabolic syndrome and cardiometabolic risk factors, including BMI and blood pressure. This was supported by two randomised controlled intervention studies showing that consuming meals regularly for 2 weeks v. an irregular meal pattern, led to beneficial impact on cardiometabolic risk factors as lower peak insulin, lower fasting total and LDL-cholesterol, both in lean and obese women. In conclusion, the limited evidence on meal regularity and cardiometabolic consequences supports the hypothesis that consuming meals irregularly is adversely associated with cardiometabolic risk. However, it also highlights the need for more large-scale studies, including detailed dietary assessment to further advance the understanding of the impact of chrono-nutrition on public health.

Time-Restricted Eating and Metabolic Syndrome: Current Status and Future Perspectives

Number of 

Key takeaways:Time-restricted eating (TRE) shows promise in improving cardiometabolic health in individuals with metabolic syndrome, potentially reducing long-term cardiometabolic risk and improving overall health.

Abstract:Metabolic syndrome (MetS) occurs in ~30% of adults and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. MetS reflects the clustering of individual cardiometabolic risk factors including central obesity, elevated fasting plasma glucose, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood pressure. Erratic eating patterns such as eating over a prolonged period per day and irregular meal timing are common in patients with MetS. Misalignment between daily rhythms of food intake and circadian timing system can contribute to circadian rhythm disruption which results in abnormal metabolic regulation and adversely impacts cardiometabolic health. Novel approaches which aim at restoring robust circadian rhythms through modification of timing and duration of daily eating represent a promising strategy for patients with MetS. Restricting eating period during a day (time-restricted eating, TRE) can aid in mitigating circadian disruption and improving cardiometabolic outcomes. Previous pilot TRE study of patients with MetS showed the feasibility of TRE and improvements in body weight and fat, abdominal obesity, atherogenic lipids, and blood pressure, which were observed despite no overt attempt to change diet quantity and quality or physical activity. The present article aims at giving an overview of TRE human studies of individuals with MetS or its components, summarizing current clinical evidence for improving cardiometabolic health through TRE intervention in these populations, and presenting future perspectives for an implementation of TRE to treat and prevent MetS. Previous TRE trials laid the groundwork and indicate a need for further clinical research including large-scale controlled trials to determine TRE efficacy for reducing long-term cardiometabolic risk, providing tools for sustained lifestyle changes and, ultimately, improving overall health in individuals with MetS.

Key takeaways:Poor sleep efficiency and later bedtime routines are associated with more pronounced postprandial glycemic responses to breakfast, making sleep a modifiable therapeutic target for optimal metabolic health.

Abstract:Sleep, diet and exercise are fundamental to metabolic homeostasis. In this secondary analysis of a repeated measures, nutritional intervention study, we tested whether an individual's sleep quality, duration and timing impact glycaemic response to a breakfast meal the following morning.Healthy adults' data (N = 953 ) were analysed from the PREDICT dietary intervention trial. Participants consumed isoenergetic standardised meals over 2 weeks in the clinic and at home. Actigraphy was used to assess sleep variables (duration, efficiency, timing) and continuous glucose monitors were used to measure glycaemic variation (>8000 meals).Sleep variables were significantly associated with postprandial glycaemic control (2 h incremental AUC), at both between- and within-person levels. Sleep period time interacted with meal type, with a smaller effect of poor sleep on postprandial blood glucose levels when high-carbohydrate (low fat/protein) (pinteraction = 0.02) and high-fat (pinteraction = 0.03) breakfasts were consumed compared with a reference 75 g OGTT. Within-person sleep period time had a similar interaction (high carbohydrate: pinteraction = 0.001, high fat: pinteraction = 0.02). Within- and between-person sleep efficiency were significantly associated with lower postprandial blood glucose levels irrespective of meal type (both p < 0.03). Later sleep midpoint (time deviation from midnight) was found to be significantly associated with higher postprandial glucose, in both between-person and within-person comparisons (p = 0.035 and p = 0.051, respectively).Poor sleep efficiency and later bedtime routines are associated with more pronounced postprandial glycaemic responses to breakfast the following morning. A person's deviation from their usual sleep pattern was also associated with poorer postprandial glycaemic control. These findings underscore sleep as a modifiable, non-pharmacological therapeutic target for the optimal regulation of human metabolic health. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03479866.

Adverse Metabolic Consequences in Humans of Prolonged Sleep Restriction Combined with Circadian Disruption

Number of 

Key takeaways:Prolonged sleep restriction combined with circadian disruption impairs glucose regulation and metabolism, potentially leading to metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

Abstract:Sleep deficiency and out-of-synch circadian rhythms impair pancreatic insulin secretion, a possible precursor to metabolic syndrome and diabetes. A Reason to Go to Bed on Time Our own experience tells us that getting too little sleep or traveling across multiple time zones can impair our ability to function. And people who work on the night shift or who habitually sleep too little are more likely to be obese or have diabetes. But what is it about these stresses that translate into faulty physiology? By simulating the life-style of a shift worker or world traveler in controlled laboratory conditions, Buxton et al. now find that prolonged, simultaneous disruption of our normal sleep and circadian rhythms affects the workings of our insulin-secreting pancreatic cells, creating a prediabetic state. And even worse, under these conditions, people show a drop in their resting metabolic rate that could translate into a yearly weight gain of more than 10 pounds. Getting a firm handle on the effects of life-style changes such as sleep, activity schedule, and diet on pancreatic function is much easier in small animals than humans. But Buxton et al. successfully investigated these questions by hosting 21 human participants in a completely controlled environment for almost 6 weeks and simulating disturbances in sleep and circadian rhythms, while keeping diet constant and scheduling all activities. Because sleep and circadian rhythms are intimately related, they designed a special protocol to independently manipulate these variables. After a stabilization segment in which the participants had adequate sleep at the appropriate time within their circadian rhythms, the participants spent 3 weeks in which they got only 5.6 hours of sleep per 24-hour period, while simultaneously experiencing 28-hour circadian days—a state similar to 4 hours of jet lag accumulating each day. During this time, the participants were often trying to sleep at unusual times within their circadian cycle. A segment of 9 recovery days followed. During the 3-week disruption, the participants’ glucose control went haywire, and they were unable to mount a sufficiently high insulin response after a meal, resulting in too much glucose in their blood, in some cases at a level considered prediabetic. This magnitude of disruption, coupled with a lower resting metabolic rate that also emerged during the 3 treatment weeks, could easily set the stage for development of diabetes and obesity, although the exact process by which this happens awaits further study. These results carry a cautionary message for employers to guard against causing adverse metabolic effects in workers by their shift scheduling practices—and a reinforcement of your mother’s message to go to bed on time and get enough sleep. Epidemiological studies link short sleep duration and circadian disruption with higher risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. We tested the hypotheses that prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, as can occur in people performing shift work, impairs glucose regulation and metabolism. Healthy adults spent >5 weeks under controlled laboratory conditions in which they experienced an initial baseline segment of optimal sleep, 3 weeks of sleep restriction (5.6 hours of sleep per 24 hours) combined with circadian disruption (recurring 28-hour “days”), followed by 9 days of recovery sleep with circadian re-entrainment. Exposure to prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, with measurements taken at the same circadian phase, decreased the participants’ resting metabolic rate and increased plasma glucose concentrations after a meal, an effect resulting from inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion. These parameters normalized during the 9 days of recovery sleep and stable circadian re-entrainment. Thus, in humans, prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption alters metabolism and could increase the risk of obesity and diabetes.

Beneficial Effects of Early Time-Restricted Feeding on Metabolic Diseases: Importance of Aligning Food Habits with the Circadian Clock

Number of 

Key takeaways:Aligning food habits with the circadian clock may improve metabolic health and help combat metabolic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract:The importance of metabolic health is a major societal concern due to the increasing prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and various cardiovascular diseases. The circadian clock is clearly implicated in the development of these metabolic diseases. Indeed, it regulates physiological processes by hormone modulation, thus helping the body to perform them at the ideal time of day. Since the industrial revolution, the actions and rhythms of everyday life have been modified and are characterized by changes in sleep pattern, work schedules, and eating habits. These modifications have in turn lead to night shift, social jetlag, late-night eating, and meal skipping, a group of customs that causes circadian rhythm disruption and leads to an increase in metabolic risks. Intermittent fasting, especially the time-restricted eating, proposes a solution: restraining the feeding window from 6 to 10 h per day to match it with the circadian clock. This approach seems to improve metabolic health markers and could be a therapeutic solution to fight against metabolic diseases. This review summarizes the importance of matching life habits with circadian rhythms for metabolic health and assesses the advantages and limits of the application of time-restricted fasting with the objective of treating and preventing metabolic diseases.

Irregular meal-pattern effects on energy expenditure, metabolism, and appetite regulation: a randomized controlled trial in healthy normal-weight women.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Meal regularity is associated with greater thermic effect of food and lower glucose responses, potentially favoring weight management and metabolic health.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Obesity is increasing in parallel with greater all-day food availability. The latter may promote meal irregularity, dysregulation of the energy balance, and poor metabolic health.

OBJECTIVE
We investigated the effect of meal irregularity on the thermic effect of food (TEF), lipid concentrations, carbohydrate metabolism, subjective appetite, and gut hormones in healthy women.

DESIGN
Eleven normal-weight women (18-40 y of age) were recruited in a randomized crossover trial with two 14-d isoenergetic diet periods (identical foods provided and free living) that were separated by a 14-d habitual diet washout period. In period 1, participants followed a regular meal pattern (6 meals/d) or an irregular meal pattern (3-9 meals/d), and in period 2, the alternative meal pattern was followed. Before and after each period, when participants were fasting and for 3 h after intake of a test drink, measurements were taken of energy expenditure, circulating glucose, lipids (fasting only), insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and ghrelin. An ad libitum test meal was offered. Subjective appetite ratings were assessed while fasting, after the test drink, after the ad libitum meal, and during the intervention. Continuous interstitial glucose monitoring was undertaken for 3 consecutive days during each intervention, and the ambulatory activity pattern was recorded (ambulatory energy expenditure estimation).

RESULTS
Regularity was associated with a greater TEF (P < 0.05) and a lower incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose after intake of the test drink (over 3 h) and, for some identical meals, during the 2 interventions (over 90 min) (day 7: after breakfast; day 9: after lunch and dinner). There was no difference between treatments for the test-drink gut hormone response. A time effect was noted for fasting GLP-1, fasting PYY, PYY responses, and hunger-rating responses to the test drink (P < 0.05). Lower hunger and higher fullness ratings were seen premeal and postmeal during the regular period while subjects were free living.

CONCLUSION
Meal regularity appears to be associated with greater TEF and lower glucose responses, which may favor weight management and metabolic health. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02052076.

Meal Timing and Sleeping Energy Metabolism

Number of 

Key takeaways:Time-restricted eating for extended durations can decrease energy intake and body weight, with early time-restricted eating having greater effects than midday time-restricted eating.

Abstract:There is a physiological link between sleep and eating. Insufficient sleep is a risk factor for overeating and excess body weight gain, and molecules such as orexin and insulin play a role in the control of sleep and energy intake. The effects of dietary timing on sleep and energy metabolism were examined in this review. First, we examined sleep energy metabolism and sleep quality under time-restricted eating, including skipping breakfast or dinner. Second, the mechanisms, benefits, and translational potential of the effects of time-restricted diets on sleep were discussed. Time-restricted eating under controlled conditions, in which daily caloric intake was kept constant, affected the time course of energy metabolism but did not affect total energy expenditure over 24 h. In free-living conditions, time-restricted eating for extended durations (4–16 weeks) decreased energy intake and body weight, and the effects of early time-restricted eating were greater than that of midday time-restricted eating. Although assessment of sleep by polysomnographic recording remains to be performed, no negative effects on the subjective quality of sleep have been observed.

Sleep Apnea and Sleep Habits: Relationships with Metabolic Syndrome

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sleep habits and sleep apnea contribute to metabolic syndrome, and personalized lifestyle interventions should address these factors along with diet and physical activity.

Abstract:Excess visceral adiposity is a primary cause of metabolic syndrome and often results from excess caloric intake and a lack of physical activity. Beyond these well-known etiologic factors, however, sleep habits and sleep apnea also seem to contribute to abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome: Evidence suggests that sleep deprivation and behaviors linked to evening chronotype and social jetlag affect eating behaviors like meal preferences and eating times. When circadian rest and activity rhythms are disrupted, hormonal and metabolic regulations also become desynchronized, and this is known to contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. The metabolic consequences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) also contribute to incident metabolic syndrome. These observations, along with the first sleep intervention studies, have demonstrated that sleep is a relevant lifestyle factor that needs to be addressed along with diet and physical activity. Personalized lifestyle interventions should be tested in subjects with metabolic syndrome, based on their specific diet and physical activity habits, but also according to their circadian preference. The present review therefore focuses (i) on the role of sleep habits in the development of metabolic syndrome, (ii) on the reciprocal relationship between sleep apnea and metabolic syndrome, and (iii) on the results of sleep intervention studies.

Irregular breakfast eating in type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with greater social jetlag and poorer metabolic health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Irregular breakfast eating in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with poorer metabolic health and greater social jetlag, with social jetlag affecting glycemic control through breakfast eating habits.

Abstract:Circadian disruption, arising from conflict between internal circadian time and behavioural sleep–wake and fasting–feeding rhythms, may contribute to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and disease severity. Previous studies have demonstrated a link between irregular breakfast eating and poorer metabolic health. We aimed to further explore the relationships between breakfast habits, circadian misalignment (social jetlag), and metabolic parameters in a cohort of adult participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 330 adult participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending for routine clinical review completed structured questionnaires to assess habitual sleep timing, chronotype, and social jetlag. Statistical analysis was via inferential groupwise approaches and path analysis to establish interdependencies of effects of social jetlag, chronotype, and breakfast eating regularity on HbA1c. 22.7% of the participants reported eating breakfast five times or fewer a week, and were categorised as irregular breakfast eaters. Compared with those who ate breakfast six or seven times a week, irregular breakfast eaters had significantly higher HbA1c and diastolic blood pressure, were younger and had greater social jetlag. In the path analysis, irregular breakfast eating exerted a direct effect on HbA1c, whilst social jetlag exerted only an indirect effect on HbA1c through breakfast eating regularity. Chronotype did not exert any effect on HbA1c, but did exert an indirect effect on breakfast eating regularity via social jetlag. Our results showed that adult participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who ate breakfast irregularly had poorer metabolic health and greater social jetlag. The relationship between social jetlag and glycaemic control appears to be mediated through breakfast eating habits.

Connecting insufficient sleep and insomnia with metabolic dysfunction

Number of 

Key takeaways:Insufficient sleep and insomnia are linked to metabolic dysfunction, leading to weight gain and increased risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Abstract:The global epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes parallels the rampant state of sleep deprivation in our society. Epidemiological studies consistently show an association between insufficient sleep and metabolic dysfunction. Mechanistically, sleep and circadian rhythm exert considerable influences on hormones involved in appetite regulation and energy metabolism. As such, data from experimental sleep deprivation in humans demonstrate that insufficient sleep induces a positive energy balance with resultant weight gain, due to increased energy intake that far exceeds the additional energy expenditure of nocturnal wakefulness, and adversely impacts glucose metabolism. Conversely, animal models have found that sleep loss–induced energy expenditure exceeds caloric intake resulting in net weight loss. However, animal models have significant limitations, which may diminish the clinical relevance of their metabolic findings. Clinically, insomnia disorder and insomnia symptoms are associated with adverse glucose outcomes, though it remains challenging to isolate the effects of insomnia on metabolic outcomes independent of comorbidities and insufficient sleep durations. Furthermore, both pharmacological and behavioral interventions for insomnia may have direct metabolic effects. The goal of this review is to establish an updated framework for the causal links between insufficient sleep and insomnia and risks for type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Effect of Breakfast Consumption and Meal Time Regularity on Nutrient Intake and Cardiometabolic Health in Korean Adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regular breakfast consumption and meal times are associated with healthy lifestyle habits and adequate nutrient intake, helping prevent obesity and related metabolic disorders in Korean adults.

Abstract:Objective Dietary factors are important contributors to obesity and related metabolic disorders. Few studies have evaluated the impact of dietary habits (e.g., breakfast consumption frequency and meal regularity) on metabolic health. We investigated the effects of breakfast consumption frequency and meal time regularity on nutrient intake and cardiometabolic status in Korean adults. Methods Participants without diagnosed diseases (n=217) were examined for anthropometric and biochemical parameters, lifestyle, dietary habits, and nutrient intake. They were categorized into 4 groups by breakfast consumption frequency (≥6 or <6 times/week) and meal time regularity (regular or irregular): breakfast ≥6 times/week and regular eating (HBRE), breakfast ≥6 times/week and irregular eating (HBIE), breakfast <6 times/week and regular eating (LBRE) and breakfast <6 times/week and irregular eating (LBIE). Results Participants in the LBIE group were the youngest, had higher waist circumference, body mass index, triglyceride levels, and inflammation, and consumed the highest daily total caloric intake (TCI), the highest proportion of fats, and the lowest proportion of carbohydrates. The LBIE group also had the lowest proportion of energy intake at breakfast and the highest proportion at dinner. The LBIE group consumed the lowest amounts of fiber, beta-carotene, vitamin K, folate, calcium and iron, and had the highest prevalence of inadequate nutrient intake for TCI, protein, vitamins A, C, B6, and B12, folate, calcium, iron, zinc, and copper. Conclusion Regular breakfast consumption and meal times are related to healthy lifestyle habits and adequate nutrient intake, which affect metabolic health, thereby helping prevent obesity and related metabolic disorders.

Impact of insufficient sleep on total daily energy expenditure, food intake, and weight gain

Number of 

Key takeaways:Insufficient sleep increases daily energy expenditure but leads to weight gain due to increased food intake and reduced dietary restraint.

Abstract:Insufficient sleep is associated with obesity, yet little is known about how repeated nights of insufficient sleep influence energy expenditure and balance. We studied 16 adults in a 14- to 15-d-long inpatient study and quantified effects of 5 d of insufficient sleep, equivalent to a work week, on energy expenditure and energy intake compared with adequate sleep. We found that insufficient sleep increased total daily energy expenditure by ∼5%; however, energy intake—especially at night after dinner—was in excess of energy needed to maintain energy balance. Insufficient sleep led to 0.82 ± 0.47 kg (±SD) weight gain despite changes in hunger and satiety hormones ghrelin and leptin, and peptide YY, which signaled excess energy stores. Insufficient sleep delayed circadian melatonin phase and also led to an earlier circadian phase of wake time. Sex differences showed women, not men, maintained weight during adequate sleep, whereas insufficient sleep reduced dietary restraint and led to weight gain in women. Our findings suggest that increased food intake during insufficient sleep is a physiological adaptation to provide energy needed to sustain additional wakefulness; yet when food is easily accessible, intake surpasses that needed. We also found that transitioning from an insufficient to adequate/recovery sleep schedule decreased energy intake, especially of fats and carbohydrates, and led to −0.03 ± 0.50 kg weight loss. These findings provide evidence that sleep plays a key role in energy metabolism. Importantly, they demonstrate physiological and behavioral mechanisms by which insufficient sleep may contribute to overweight and obesity.

Circadian clock and temporal meal pattern

Number of 

Key takeaways:Breakfast consumption is beneficial for metabolic health, while irregular meal patterns and caloric restriction can negatively impact metabolism and lifespan.

Abstract:Abstract The central circadian clock in the brain controls the time-of-the-day variations in acute meal responses, with a low glycemic response but a high satiety/thermogenic response to meals consumed at waking compared to other time points. Consistently, studies show that consuming a significant proportion of calories, particularly carbohydrates, in breakfast is beneficial for the chronic management of obesity and its associated metabolic syndrome, compared to consuming identical meals at dinner. Conversely, breakfast skipping or/and late dinner can have unfavorable metabolic outcomes. It remains controversial how meal frequency affects metabolic health. In contrast, irregular meals, especially irregular breakfasts, show consistent adverse metabolic consequences. Time-restricted feeding (TRF), with all calories consumed within less than 12-h per day, can improve metabolism and extend lifespan. A major component of TRF in humans is caloric restriction, which contributes significantly to the beneficial effects of TRF in humans. By comparison, TRF effects in rodents can be independent of caloric restriction and show day/night phase specificity. TRF could alleviate metabolic abnormalities due to circadian disruption, but its effects appear independent of the circadian clock in rodents. Understanding neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying clock-mediated metabolic regulation will shed light on the metabolic effects of temporal meal patterns.

Metabolic Effects of Late Dinner in Healthy Volunteers - A Randomized Crossover Clinical Trial.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late dinner consumption leads to nocturnal glucose intolerance and reduced fatty acid oxidation, potentially promoting obesity if repeated chronically.

Abstract:CONTEXT
Consuming calories later in the day is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that eating a late dinner alters substrate metabolism during sleep in a manner that promotes obesity.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the impact of late dinner on nocturnal metabolism in healthy volunteers.

DESIGN AND SETTING
This is a randomized crossover trial of late dinner (LD, 22:00) versus routine dinner (RD, 18:00), with a fixed sleep period (23:00-07:00) in a laboratory setting.

PARTICIPANTS
20 healthy volunteers (10 males, 10 females), aged 26.0 ± 0.6 years, BMI 23.2 ± 0.7 kg/m2, accustomed to a bedtime between 22:00-01:00.

INTERVENTIONS
An isocaloric macronutrient diet was administered on both visits. Dinner (35% daily kcal, 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat) with an oral lipid tracer ( palmitate, 15 mg/kg) was given at 18:00 on RD and 22:00 on LD.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Nocturnal and next-morning hourly plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFAs), cortisol, dietary fatty acid oxidation, and overnight polysomnography.

RESULTS
LD caused a 4-hour shift in the postprandial period, overlapping with the sleep phase. Independent of this shift, the postprandial period following LD was characterized by higher glucose, a triglyceride peak delay, and lower FFA and dietary fatty acid oxidation. LD did not affect sleep architecture, but increased plasma cortisol. These metabolic changes were most pronounced in habitual earlier sleepers determined by actigraphy monitoring.

CONCLUSION
LD induces nocturnal glucose intolerance, and reduces fatty acid oxidation and mobilization, particularly in earlier sleepers. These effects might promote obesity if they recur chronically.

Key takeaways:Late dinnertime increases nocturnal glucose, insulin, cortisol, and decreases FFA, potentially promoting obesity development during sleep.

Abstract:Introduction: Consuming calories later in the day is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.We hypothesized that eating a late dinner alters metabolic function during sleep in a manner that promotes obesity.Methods: We compared metabolic effects of routine dinnertime (RD, 18:00) versus late dinnertime (LD, 22:00) with a fixed sleep period (23:00-07:00) on the daily metabolic profile of healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study.An isocaloric diet was administered at 8:00, 13:00, 18:00, or 22:00.For RD, dinner (35% daily kcal) was given at 18:00 and a snack (10% kcal) was given at 22:00; for LD, these meals were reversed.Peripheral venous blood samples were collected at 1-hour intervals from 17:00 to 12:00 the next day on both visits.We assessed plasma triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFAs), glucose, insulin, cortisol, and sleep architecture.Participants ingested a lipid tracer, palmitate with dinner to measure fatty acid oxidation.Time series data was analyzed using mixed effects regression models.Results: To date, eight participants (5 male and 3 females) aged 26.4 ± 0.7 years old, with a BMI of 24.1 ± 1.2 kg/m 2 completed the study.During sleep, LD increased plasma glucose (β=16.8mg/dl, P<0.001), insulin (β=15.4μU/ml, P<0.001), cortisol (β=1.5 μg/dl, P=0.017), and decreased plasma FFA (β=-0.1 mmol/l, P<0.001).Morning glucose, insulin, cortisol and FFA levels were not significantly different between two visits.Morning TG were increased by RD (β=17.4mg/dl, P<0.001).The evening postprandial period following LD was characterized by higher glucose and lower FFA as compared to RD (P<0.05).Fatty acid oxidation will be measured by serial enrichment of plasma 2 H 2 0 (pending).Dinner time did not affect sleep architecture.Conclusion: LD increases nocturnal glucose, insulin, cortisol, and decreases FFA.The inhibition of nocturnal lipolysis with LD may lower morning TG.Overall, LD leads to an anabolic state during sleep that might promote the development of obesity.

Timing and Composition of Last Meal before Bedtime Affect Sleep Parameters of Night Workers

Number of 

Key takeaways:The timing and composition of the last meal before bedtime are key factors for good diurnal and nocturnal sleep in night-shift workers.

Abstract:Night workers tend to eat irregularly, both in terms of meal times and composition. The disruption in energy metabolism caused by inappropriate eating habits can negatively affect the sleep quality of these individuals. The objectives of this study were to determine the interval between the last meal and bedtime and its relationship with both diurnal and nocturnal sleep parameters, as well as to evaluate the association of the adequacy of this meal with sleep parameters. The analyses were carried out for a usual sleep routine on a workday and a day off. This cross-sectional study was part of a controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial. The sample comprised 30 female nursing professionals who worked permanent night shifts of 12 × 36 h. Timing and composition of the last meal were obtained from food diaries, and sleep parameters were collected via actigraphy. On multiple linear regression analysis, every hour decrease in the interval between the last meal and sleep onset there was an increase of 0.39 h on diurnal sleep duration. Regarding food intake, every 1 g of fat and 1 g of carbohydrate consumed was associated with an increase in diurnal sleep onset latency of 0.13 h and 0.02 h, respectively. These findings suggest that both timing and composition of the last meal before bedtime may be potential key factors for good diurnal and nocturnal sleep among night-shift workers.

Irregular sleep and event schedules are associated with poorer self-reported well-being in US college students.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Irregular sleep and event schedules are linked to lower well-being in college students, suggesting that stabilizing these schedules may improve overall well-being.

Abstract:STUDY OBJECTIVES
Sleep regularity, in addition to duration and timing, is predictive of daily variations in well-being. One possible contributor to changes in these sleep dimensions are early morning scheduled events. We applied a composite metric - the Composite Phase Deviation (CPD) - to assess mistiming and irregularity of both sleep and event schedules to examine their relationship with self-reported well-being in US college students.

METHODS
Daily well-being, actigraphy, and timing of sleep and first scheduled events (academic/exercise/other) were collected for ~30 days from 223 US college students (37% females) between 2013 and 2016. Participants rated well-being daily upon awakening on five scales: Sleepy-Alert, Sad-Happy, Sluggish-Energetic, Sick-Healthy, and Stressed-Calm. A longitudinal growth model with time-varying covariates was used to assess relationships between sleep variables (i.e., CPDSleep, sleep duration, and midsleep time) and daily and average well-being. Cluster analysis was used to examine relationships between CPD for sleep vs. event schedules.

RESULTS
CPD for sleep was a significant predictor of average well-being (e.g., Stressed-Calm: b=-6.3, p<0.01), whereas sleep duration was a significant predictor of daily well-being (Stressed-Calm, b=1.0, p<0.001). While cluster analysis revealed no systematic relationship between CPD for sleep vs. event schedules (i.e., more mistimed/irregular events were not associated with more mistimed/irregular sleep), they interacted upon well-being: the poorest well-being was reported by students for whom both sleep and event schedules were mistimed and irregular.

CONCLUSION
Sleep regularity and duration may be risk factors for lower well-being in college students. Stabilizing sleep and/or event schedules may help improve well-being.

Eating habits are associated with subjective sleep quality outcomes among university students: findings of a cross-sectional study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Healthy eating habits, such as skipping breakfast and replacing meals with snacks, may improve sleep quality and sleep components among university students.

Abstract:PurposeThis study investigated the relationships between eating habits and sleep quality among university students.MethodsIn a cross-sectional study, university students completed a self-report questionnaire to assess eating habits and meal timing. We assessed subjective sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and examined the associations between eating habits and overall sleep quality and its components.ResultsFour hundred ninety-eight students participated in the study. Students who used to skip breakfast, ate late-night snacks, and replaced meals with snacks were at 1.20 times, 1.24 times, and 1.25 times higher likelihood of having poor overall sleep quality, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that skipping breakfast (r =  − 0.111, P = 0.007), late-night snacks (r =  − 0.109, P = 0.007), replacing meals with snacks (r =  − 0.126, P = 0.002), and irregular mealtimes (r =  − 0.094, P = 0.018) were the best correlates with poor sleep quality. After adjustment to demographic variables, replacing meals with snacks followed by skipping breakfast were the best independent associations with poor sleep quality by the PSQI.ConclusionsEating habits and meal timing were significantly associated with sleep quality. We speculate that healthy eating habits may lead to improved sleep quality and sleep components among university students.

Chronobiological perspectives: Association between meal timing and sleep quality

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late meal timing and more frequent meal occasions are associated with poor sleep quality.

Abstract:Background Meal timing has been associated with metabolism and cardiovascular diseases; however, the relationship between meal timing and sleep quality remains inconclusive. Objective This study aims to investigate the relationship between meal timing and sleep quality from a chronobiological perspective. Methods This study utilized data from the NHANES for the years 2005–2008, including a cohort of 7,023 participants after applying exclusion criteria. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Meal timing was analyzed based on two 24-hour dietary recalls from each individual, considering the timing of the initial and final meals, meal duration, and frequency of meal occasions. Multiple linear regression models and hierarchical analyses were employed to examine the relationship between meal timing and PSQI scores, adjusting for various demographic and habitat covariates. Results Statistical analysis revealed a positive correlation between delayed meal timings, increased meal occasions, and elevated PSQI scores, indicating that later meal timing are intricately linked with diminished sleep quality. Both later meal timings and more frequent meal occasions were significantly associated with poorer sleep quality. Compared to the first tertile, the β (95%CI) values of the third tertile were 0.545 (0.226, 0.864) for first meal timing, 0.586 (0.277, 0.896) for midpoint meal timing, 0.385 (0.090, 0.680) for last meal timing, and 0.332 (0.021, 0.642) for meal occasions in the adjusted models. Conclusion These findings suggest that late initial, midpoint, and final meal timing, as well as more frequent meal occasions, are chrono-nutrition patterns associated with poor sleep quality.

Sleep duration, nightshift work, and the timing of meals and urinary levels of 8-isoprostane and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in Japanese women

Number of 

Key takeaways:Longer sleep duration and regular meal timing are associated with lower urinary levels of 8-isoprostane, while irregular meal timing and nightshift work increase 8-isoprostane levels.

Abstract:ABSTRACT It has been hypothesized that disruption of circadian rhythms affects human health. Shift work and sleep deprivation are thought to disrupt the normal light–dark cycle, although the disruption due to shiftwork may be dependent on sleep deprivation. Both conditions have been suggested to be associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders. Non-photic environmental factors, such as the timing of eating, are also thought to regulate circadian rhythm and thus, may have effects on health, but the evidence from human studies is scarce. Oxidative stress is a risk factor of cardiometabolic disorders. Some laboratory studies suggest an involvement of circadian clock genes in the regulation of the redox system. The present study aimed to examine the association of sleeping habits, nightshift work, and the timing of meals with urinary levels of 8-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, the principal metabolite of melatonin. Study subjects were 542 women who had previously attended a breast cancer mass screening in a community in Japan. Information on bedtimes and wake-up times, history of nightshift work, and the timing of meals was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. The 8-isoprostane and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were measured using the first morning void of urine and expressed per mg of creatinine. The geometric mean of 8-isoprostane levels was 12.1% higher in women with ≤6 hours of sleep than that in those with >8 hours of sleep on weekdays, and longer sleep duration on weekdays was significantly associated with lower urinary levels of 8-isoprostane after controlling for covariates (p for trend = 0.04). Women who were currently working the nightshift had a 33.3% higher geometric mean of 8-isoprostane levels than those who were not working nightshift (p = 0.03). Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were unrelated to sleep habits or nightshift work. Women who ate breakfast at irregular times had a 19.8% higher geometric mean of 8-isoprostane levels than those who ate breakfast at a regular time or who did not eat (p = 0.02). Women who ate nighttime snacks at irregular times had a 16.2% higher geometric mean of 8-isoprostane levels than those who did not eat nighttime snacks or who ate nighttime snacks at a regular time (p = 0.003). Among women who ate dinner at a regular time, earlier times for dinner were associated with higher 8-isoprostane and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels (p values for trends were 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). However, the times of dinner and nighttime snack are overlapping, and the time of last meal of the day was not associated with 8-isoprostane and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels. The time of breakfast or lunch was not associated with these biomarkers among women who ate the meal at regular times. Disturbing the rhythmicity of daily life may be associated with oxidative stress.

Short sleep time may be the main reason for irregular breakfast to cause overweight—a cross-sectional study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Short sleep duration may be the main reason for irregular breakfast leading to overweight, with adequate outdoor exercise being essential for weight maintenance.

Abstract:Introduction In recent years, the relationship between circadian rhythm and overweight and obesity has attracted the attention of many scholars. Methods To evaluate association between the duration of sleep and the regularity of breakfast and overweight. A total of 1,178 students from Qingdao University were selected by stratified cluster sampling. There were 601 males (24.69 ± 0.80 years old) and 569 females (24.54 ± 0.70 years old). We used body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) to define overweight levels. Chi-square test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression were applied to test association among overweight, sleep duration, sleep onset time, and breakfast regularity. Pittsburgh sleep quality index was used to assess the overall sleep quality of the study subjects. Mediation effect and Sobel test were used to analyze the effect of sleep duration on breakfast regularity and overweight. Results Only 34.1% of the population ate breakfast every day, and eating breakfast 1–3 times per week was associated with a higher risk of overweight (BMI: OR = 2.183, 95%CI: 1.369,3,481; WC: OR = 2.101, 95%CI: 1.232,3,583; WHR: OR = 2.108, 95%CI: 1.331,3,337). The effects of all types of Usual Breakfast Consumption Frequency on overweight were fully mediated by sleep duration (p < 0.05). In particular, the subjects exercised outdoors more than five times per week slept longer (p < 0.05). Conclusion Short sleep duration may be the main reason for irregular breakfast leading to overweight. Adequate outdoor exercise is essential for weight maintenance.

1007 Sociodemographic, Lifestyle and Dietary Correlates of Actigraphy-Measured Irregular Sleep Schedules in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Irregular sleep schedules are associated with lower income, higher depressive symptoms, higher BMI, and current smoking, as well as lower Alternative Healthy Eating Index and circadian disruption.

Abstract:Increasing evidence links daily variability in sleep schedules to increased cardiometabolic risk. Little is known, however, regarding sociodemographic and behavioral correlates of irregular sleep schedules that may help identify causes or consequences of irregular sleep.
 
 
 
 Among 1,946 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, we examined the cross-sectional associations of irregular sleep schedules with sociodemographic, lifestyle, dietary factors, and actigraphy-based indices of rest-wake rhythms using multiple linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status and work schedules. Sleep regularity was assessed using standard deviations (SD) in actigraphy-measured sleep duration and sleep onset timing across 7 days.
 
 
 
 Compared to Whites, the 7-day sleep duration SD (95% CI) was 17.4min (12.6, 22.2) higher in African-Americans, 10.4min (4.8, 16.0) higher in Hispanics and 7.9min (1.3, 14.4) higher in Chinese. Shift versus regular work was associated with 11.4min (5.1, 17.7) higher sleep duration SD. Irregular sleep duration was associated with lower income (p=0.006), higher depressive symptoms (p<0.0001), higher BMI (p=0.004) and current smoking (p=0.06). Higher sleep duration variability was associated with lower Alternative Healthy Eating Index (p=0.01), mainly due to suboptimal intakes of fruits, whole grains and nuts/legumes. No associations were observed for age, sex, education, marital status or number of meals per day. While sleep duration variability was not associated with self-reported physical activity level or actigraphy-measured 7-day mean activity count, sleep duration SD was inversely associated with relative amplitude (difference between the most versus the least active period; p<0.0001) and inter-daily stability (synchronization between rest-activity patterns and environmental zeitgebers; p<0.0001) of 24-h rest-activity patterns. Similar results were observed for sleep onset timing SD.
 
 
 
 Substantial differences by sociodemographic factors exist regarding the consistency of day-to-day sleep schedules. Irregular sleep schedules are associated with overall circadian disruption across the day and some unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Future studies are needed to understand temporal relationships of the observed associations.

Instability in daily life and depression: The impact of sleep variance between weekday and weekend in South Korean workers.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Variance in sleep duration between weekdays and weekends is associated with increased depressive symptoms among South Korean workers.

Abstract:South Korean workers have problems getting optimal sleep because they work excessively, and this affects their sleep duration and quality. To compensate for their lack of sleep on weekdays, South Korean workers have a different lifestyle on weekends, which is reflected by the terms 'Hot Friday' and 'Monday Sickness'. However, an irregular lifestyle may be a risk factor for poor health even if insufficient sleep during weekdays is supplemented by sleep on the weekend. The objective of this study was to analyse the association between depressive mood and sleep duration variance on weekdays and weekends among South Korean workers. Data from the 2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association between variance in sleep duration and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score. Additional sub-group analyses were performed to evaluate associations between variance in sleep duration and sex, marital status and perceived health status. The average sleep duration was 419.44 min on weekdays and 463.29 min on weekends. The average sleep duration on weekends was 11.73% longer than on weekdays. There was a positive association between variance in sleep and PHQ-9 score (per 1% increased, β = 0.002, p = .0074), and variance in sleep duration affected health regardless of the direction of the change (positive: increased sleep or negative: decreased sleep). Further, sub-group analyses showed that variances in sleep duration are associated with increased PHQ-9 scores in females and in individuals who were single or who had problems in their marriage. Our findings suggest that there is a relationship between variance in sleep duration and depressive symptoms among South Korean workers. Thus, healthcare professionals should suggest alternatives for optimal sleep duration and sleep methods to ensure the psychiatric health of workers.

0152 Sleep related Characteristics In Workers With Irregular Work

Number of 

Key takeaways:Irregular work schedules lead to more flexible circadian rhythms, but worse sleep quality, sleepier, and more depressed workers.

Abstract:Now a day, more and more workers choose to work without a fixed time schedule and/or work space. It is of interest to examine whether workers with this modernized work pattern have specific sleep-related characteristics. Therefore, the current study addressed this issue by comparing sleep-related characteristics between workers with and without a regular work schedules. his study recruited 446 healthy adults through internet. Participants were divided into two groups by their answers on a single question “Do you work on a regular schedule?”. Those who answer “no” were assigned to the NR group (n=199), and “yes” were assigned to the RW group (n=247). They were asked to complete a survey that included: a questionnaires for demographic information, the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ; Horne & Östberg, 1976), the Circadian Type Inventory (CTI; Folkard, 1987), the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ; Roenneberg et al., 2006), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; Johns, 1997), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Morin, 2001), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarack & Mermelstein, 1983), the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), and the Situational Fatigue Scale (SFS; Yang & Wu, 2005). Independent t-tests were conducted to compare the ratings on the questionnaires between two groups. Significant differences between two groups were found on the score of MEQ , Flexibility/Rigidity (FR) factor of CTI, ISI, ESS, PSS, and CESD . RW group have found to have higher score on MEQ, FR factor of CTI and ESS scores. On the other hand, NR group showed higher ISI, PSS, and CESD score than RW. There were no significant difference on Languid/Vigorous (LV) factor of CTI and SFS. We found several differences between the individuals with regular or irregular work schedules. The results indicated that while those workers with irregular work schedule tend to be more flexible in their circadian rhythm, they sleep worse and are sleepier and more depressed. As there are increased number of workers having irregular work schedule, their sleep quality as well as related daytime functioning need further investigation. Support (If Any)

Sleep disturbances and lack of exercise: accumulating factors for altered BMI in medical students of public sector universities

Number of 

Key takeaways:Irregular sleeping patterns and lack of physical activities contribute to underweight in medical students, affecting their focus on academic studies.

Abstract:Background: Changes in lifestyles such as lack of exercises and sleep can have negative effects on the body weight. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the association of the pattern of sleep, exercise, and diets with the body mass index (BMI) of medical students. 
Methodology: This is a cross-sectional study that incorporates self-developed questionnaires. Participants are medical university students (250) living in Karachi, Pakistan. Correlation and Pearson’s chi-square test for independence was applied to observe the association between BMI, sleep patterns, exercise and eating habits. 
Results: The age of the students were between 19-25 years.  The data show a significantly higher number of students or 6-8 hours (29.9%) sleep.  The majority of the students do not smoke (96.8%), or eat big meals before bed (62%) or consume junk foods (68.8%) on a daily basis. Nevertheless, most of them felt tired (61.1%) but not sleepy (57%) before going to bed. The majority of the students (81.4%) have problems waking up in the morning. 
Conclusion: A Significant correlation was found between BMI and sleep duration. Irregular sleeping pattern and lack of physical activities are accumulating factors for students to be underweight. Sleep disturbances affected their focus on the academic studies. Therefore, it is strongly recommended for students to participate in physical activities.

Short Sleep Duration and Skipping Main Meals among University Students

Number of 

Key takeaways:Short sleep duration is directly associated with skipping two major meals of the day, breakfast and lunch, in university students.

Abstract:Abstract Introduction  Admission to university influences lifestyle behaviors and is marked by a daily routine of accumulation of activities that can interfere with sleep duration, affecting food choices and meal consumption habits throughout the day. Objective  To analyze the association between short sleep duration and skipping main meals among university students. Materials and Methods  We conducted a cross-sectional study with 1,608 university students aged between 16 and 25 years, who were enrolled in full-time undergraduate courses at a public university in the Midwestern region of Brazil. Information on skipping breakfast, lunch, and dinner was collected through the question “On average, how often do you eat the following meals?”. Given the lack of a uniform criterion to define “skipping a meal”, in the present study, any answer that did not correspond to the daily consumption of the meal was classified as meal skipping, based on the recommendation of the Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population. Short sleep duration was determined according to sleep time during the night (≤ 6 hours for those aged ≥18 years and ≤ 7 hours for those under 18 years of age). Associations were estimated using adjusted Poisson regression models. Results  The prevalences of skipping breakfast, lunch, and dinner were of 51.0%, 13.9%, and 35.6% respectively. Short sleep duration was observed in 27.2% of the study population. After adjusting for confounding variables, short sleep duration was positively associated with skipping breakfast (adjusted prevalence ratio  = 1.20; 95% confidence interval  = 1.08–1.34) and skipping lunch (PRadj = 1.64; 95%CI = 1.27–2.12). Conclusion  University students presented a high prevalence of skipping main meals. Short sleep duration was directly associated with skipping two major meals of the day: breakfast and lunch.

Sleep and Cardiovascular Disease.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Short or long sleep durations, irregular sleep timing, and lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity, contribute to increased cardiovascular risk.

Abstract:Sleep is essential for optimal health,1 yet more than one-third of US adults report insufficient sleep2 and 50 to 70 million people in the United States experience 1 or several sleep disorders.3 Both short and long sleep (<7 or >7 hours per night, respectively) have been associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).4 Evidence links hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease to both ends of the sleep duration continuum (<5–6 hours or >8–9 hours).5,6 In addition to sleep duration, irregular sleep timing is associated with cardiovascular events.7 Irregular sleep timing (differing bedtimes and rise times for 1 week)7 represents the potential for circadian misalignment. Evidence has emerged demonstrating increased CVD risk among shift workers,8 as well as rise in cardiac events after daylight saving time,9 and in individuals who have longer sleep times on weekends compared with weekdays (called social jetlag).10,11 Populations at Risk Some populations may be at a greater risk for sleep-related CVD risk. Many factors, such as the social determinants of health and lifestyle behaviors, influence sleep. Hale and colleagues12 observed that living in disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with poor sleep quality, sleep disruptions, and insufficient sleep. Individuals with lower income and education levels experience a shorter sleep duration,13 of which occupational characteristics may play a role.14 Living arrangements and family structure have also been noted to affect sleep. Living alone and living with high levels of environmental noise contribute to sleep deficits.12,15 Adults with children report shorter sleep than those without children living in the home.12 Lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity, also influence an individual's sleep. Those who smoke report shorter sleep durations than nonsmokers and experience more insomnia symptoms than light smokers or nonsmokers.16 Alcohol consumption in nonalcoholics may promote sleep during the first half of the sleep period but disrupts sleep during the second half, leading to impaired sleep homeostasis.17 Binge drinking further disrupts sleep homeostasis.17 Women may be at a greater risk for cardiovascular effects of sleep restriction than men. Covassin and colleagues18 reported that 9 consecutive nights of sleep restriction resulted in elevated ambulatory blood pressure, impaired endothelial function, and stimulated sympathetic response among healthy adults. Of note, elevated blood pressure occurred only in women. The COVID-19 pandemic has altered lifestyles resulting in sleep disturbances. Sleep problems continue to be common during this pandemic, affecting roughly 40% of the general and healthcare populations.19 A longitudinal study demonstrated that midsleep times (the midpoint between bedtime and wake time), which are indicative of the circadian system, were delayed, whereas midsleep variability and resting heart rate decreased.20 Healthcare workers are the most vulnerable population in the fight against COVID-19 and its variants because they are on the front lines. Approximately 40% of physicians and 35% of nurses reported sleep disturbances,21 and 36% to 41% of nurses experienced insomnia symptoms.22 The Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine has issued objectives and recommendations for managing sleep problems during a pandemic. These guidelines include many resources for clinicians.23 Implications Healthy sleep requires adequate duration, regularity of timing, daytime alertness, absence of sleep disorders, and good subjective quality.1 Sleep is a potentially modifiable behavior that is critical to the promotion of health and reduction of cardiovascular risk. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine issued a position statement in June 2021. The Academy recommended that healthcare providers routinely assess sleep habits, sleep symptoms, and sleep patterns and timing during patient encounters. They recommend that sleep health be 'targeted by public health and workplace interventions to improve health-related outcomes, and behaviors that help people attain healthy sleep.'24(p2) The Academy also places a major emphasis on sleep health education in schools, in community and healthcare settings, in the workplace, and in public health policy arenas. The evidence-based recommendations issued by the Academy provide a 'call to action' for nurses and nursing underscoring the importance of quality and quantity of sleep across the life course of individuals. Cardiovascular nurses are well positioned in clinical and community-based settings to implement the recommendations and advocate for the promotion of sleep health for patients, healthcare providers, and the public.

Relationship Between Sleep Pattern and Affective States Among College Going Females

Number of 

Key takeaways:Quality of sleep is strongly associated with positive and negative affect, while duration of sleep has no significant impact on waking affective states in college going females.

Abstract:Sleep is recognized as one of the basic physiological needs.Inadequate or poor quality of sleep have been associated with several emotional and behavioral problems in daily life.Disturbance in sleeping patterns and circadian rhythms have also been implicated in serious psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety and stress.The present study aimed to examine the relationship between pattern of sleep and the affective state experienced upon waking.Pattern of sleep was defined in terms of three criteria: 1. Number of hours of sleep, 2. Quality of sleep and 3. activity engaged in before sleeping.Both dimensions of affect: positive and negative affect were examined independently.The sample consisted of 110 college going females (mean age= 21).The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS X) by Watson &Clark (1994) was used to assess the affective state of participants within one hour of waking up.A Sleep Pattern Questionnaire was developed by the researcher to record the different criteria of the participants sleep the previous night.The data was analyzed using correlation and percentage analysis.The results of the study suggested that duration of sleep has no relation with the affective state in which one wakes up as the correlation coefficients between number of hours of sleep and both positive affect (0.13) and negative affect (-0.01) were not significant.Quality of sleep showed a strong association to both positive and negative affect.Greater percentage of participants who reported having continuous, deep or satisfactory sleep reported high positive affect in comparison to participants who reported having irregular, disturbed or incomplete sleep.Conversely, greater percentage of participants who reported having irregular, disturbed or incomplete sleep reported high negative affect than those who had continuous, deep or satisfactory sleep.Having indulged in different types of activities before sleeping did not show any difference in the affective state in which participants woke up.

Insufficient Sleep Syndrome in Childhood

Number of 

Key takeaways:Insufficient sleep in children negatively impacts mental and physical development, and immediate treatment is recommended for children sleeping less than 8 hours at night or 30 to 60 minutes less than the required NBSD.

Abstract:Sleep disorders in children have a negative impact on mental and physical development, and a lack of sleep is one of the most important problems in infancy. At the age when naps are commonly accepted, the judgment of whether the amount of sleep is adequate has been based on the total amount of sleep per day. In other words, the idea is that even if the amount of sleep at night is insuﬃcient, it is not considered insuﬃcient if it is compensated for by taking a long nap or sleeping late on weekend mornings. However, these lifestyle habits disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause social jet lag, which is not appropriate for healthy mental and physical development. Therefore, in this review, I present the average required nighCime basic sleep duration (NBSD) of 10 h for Japanese and 11 h for Caucasian children as a judgment standard. (1) If the child sleeps less than 8 h at night, and (2) if the child sleeps less than 9 h at night or 30 to 60 min less than the required NBSD, immediate treatment is recommended. I also discuss briefly how to address sleep insufficiency in childhood.
