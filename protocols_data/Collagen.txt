HARM LEVEL: Abstract:The present review examines the role of collagen hydrolysates in the treatment and prevention of joint diseases.Collagen is the main structural protein of bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons in joints.Hydrolyzed collagen, as a source of specific amino acids, can be a building material for the formation of collagen fibrils in connective tissues.Enzymatic hydrolysis of chicken cartilage made it possible to obtain a complex of collagen type II hydrolysate and glycosaminoglycans.In clinical studies, hydrolysates of cutaneous collagen, type II cartilaginous collagen, and type II non-denatured cartilaginous collagen were tested.The use of collagen hydrolysates for a long time (5-6 months) allowed for improving the functioning of the knee joint in patients not only with mild but also with severe osteoarthritis.Nutraceuticals from type II collagen hydrolysates in combination with vitamin C more effectively affect the formation of collagen fibrils, and proteoglycans in the cartilage matrix and thus can affect the increase in joint mobility.Nutriciology, as a branch of modern biopharmaceutics, represents its new direction and explores possible mechanisms and ways to prevent human diseases.

Support for joints, skin, and regeneration

Collagen is a structural protein essential for the condition of joints, skin, tendons, bones, as well as hair and nails. Supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen shows well-documented beneficial effects on joint health (pain reduction, improved mobility), skin hydration and elasticity, and tissue regeneration after physical exertion. Regular collagen use may support overall fitness, reduce injury risk, and improve external appearance.

Level of evidence:Strong

Level of risk:Negligible

Collagen provides the body with key amino acids (glycine, proline, hydroxyproline) necessary for rebuilding the connective tissue matrix. Supplementation stimulates the synthesis of endogenous collagen, supports repair and regeneration of cartilage, skin, tendons, and bones. It also aids in reducing inflammation and may improve the mechanical properties of tissues, especially when combined with physical activity.

Level of risk:Negligible

Collagen is generally very well tolerated by most individuals. Adverse effects are rare and usually mild.

Collagen supplementation is not recommended for individuals with certain allergies or in specific health conditions or states.

Typical dose is 2.5–10 g daily in the form of collagen hydrolysate; most often as powder, less frequently in capsules or liquid form

Powder for mixing with liquid, capsules, ready-made shots, or liquid concentrates; bovine, marine, or porcine collagen, sometimes with added vitamin C

First effects visible after 4–12 weeks of regular use

Collagen can be taken at any time of day; most often with a meal or post-workout (especially to support tissue recovery)

For better results, combine with vitamin C and regular physical activity

What not to combine with

Do not combine with hot beverages (may denature certain types of undenatured collagen)

Consistency is key to results

To achieve full benefits, supplementation should be carried out daily for at least 8–12 weeks, ideally long-term.

Hydrolyzed form – best bioavailability

The best-studied and most easily absorbed form is collagen hydrolysate, known for its high bioavailability.

Physical activity enhances effects

The best results for joints, muscles, and skin are achieved by combining collagen supplementation with regular physical activity.

Optimal combination with vitamin C

Vitamin C supports collagen synthesis – it’s recommended to take both supplements together or choose combined products.

Pay attention to collagen source

Choose high-quality supplements with transparent composition and declared raw material source (bovine, marine, porcine).

Support for skin, hair, and nails

Collagen supplementation not only benefits joints but also improves the condition of skin, hair, and nails – choose a broad-spectrum product.

Collagen is one of the main structural components of joints and bones. Collagen supplementation, especially in hydrolyzed form, shows a positive impact on joint health, and the evidence for bone benefits is promising, though less conclusive.

Summary of clinical studies: Effects of collagen supplementation on joints and bones

Musculoskeletal system

Final comment:A strong level of evidence is supported by numerous meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and systematic reviews, which consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of collagen supplementation—especially in hydrolyzed form—in reducing joint pain, improving mobility, supporting cartilage regeneration, and providing beneficial effects on skin elasticity and hydration, hair thickness, and nail strength. The impact on bone density and strength is promising but less conclusive and requires further research. Study results are consistent and backed by credible scientific sources.

The Effects of Type I Collagen Hydrolysate Supplementation on Bones, Muscles, and Joints: A Systematic Review.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation shows promising results for joint health, but heterogeneity among studies limits the generalizability of findings.

Abstract:Introduction
Musculoskeletal discomfort is prevalent in primary care, with conditions such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis being significant contributors. Collagen, particularly type I, is a major structural protein found in connective tissues. The supplementation of type I hydrolyzed collagen has been investigated for its potential benefits in musculoskeletal health.

Objective
This systematic review aims to evaluate the current literature on the effects of type I hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on bones, muscles, and joints.

Methods
A systematic search was conducted in August 2024 using four electronic databases - PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and CINAHL. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews evaluating oral supplementation with type I hydrolyzed collagen. Exclusion criteria were pre-clinical studies, experimental studies, studies not focusing on type I hydrolyzed collagen, studies with beauty-related endpoints, studies that combined collagen with other ingredients, and unblinded, nonrandomized, and uncontrolled trials.

Results
Out of 4,246 articles screened, 36 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The study protocols varied in population, health conditions, and study duration. Studies focused on bone health faced limitations that prevent definitive conclusions about the effects of collagen supplementation. In contrast, studies on joint health reported beneficial outcomes, such as pain reduction, improvements in clinical parameters, increased physical mobility, and enhanced ankle function. The muscle health studies were inconsistent, with positive effects predominantly observed when supplementation was associated with physical exercise.

Conclusion
Collagen supplementation demonstrates promising results. However, heterogeneity among studies limits the generalizability of findings. Future research should prioritize standardized protocols and consistent outcome measures.

Collagen Supplementation for Joint Health: The Link between Composition and Scientific Knowledge

Key takeaways:Both native and hydrolyzed collagens show promise for joint health, with a clear link between their chemical structure and their mechanisms of action.

Abstract:Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, generating pain, disability, and socioeconomic costs worldwide. Currently there are no approved disease-modifying drugs for OA, and safety concerns have been identified with the chronic use of symptomatic drugs. In this context, nutritional supplements and nutraceuticals have emerged as potential alternatives. Among them, collagen is being a focus of particular interest, but under the same term different types of collagens coexist with different structures, compositions, and origins, leading to different properties and potential effects. The aim of this narrative review is to generally describe the main types of collagens currently available in marketplace, focusing on those related to joint health, describing their mechanism of action, preclinical, and clinical evidence. Native and hydrolyzed collagen are the most studied collagen types for joint health. Native collagen has a specific immune-mediated mechanism that requires the recognition of its epitopes to inhibit inflammation and tissue catabolism at articular level. Hydrolyzed collagen may contain biologically active peptides that are able to reach joint tissues and exert chondroprotective effects. Although there are preclinical and clinical studies showing the safety and efficacy of food ingredients containing both types of collagens, available research suggests a clear link between collagen chemical structure and mechanism of action.

Key takeaways:Collagen peptide supplementation combined with exercise improves joint functionality, reduces joint pain, and enhances body composition, strength, and muscle recovery.

Abstract:Abstract Collagen peptide supplementation (COL), in conjunction with exercise, may be beneficial for the management of degenerative bone and joint disorders. This is likely due to stimulatory effects of COL and exercise on the extracellular matrix of connective tissues, improving structure and load-bearing capabilities. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current literature available on the combined impact of COL and exercise. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, a literature search of three electronic databases—PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL—was conducted in June 2020. Fifteen randomised controlled trials were selected after screening 856 articles. The study populations included 12 studies in recreational athletes, 2 studies in elderly participants and 1 in untrained pre-menopausal women. Study outcomes were categorised into four topics: (i) joint pain and recovery from joint injuries, (ii) body composition, (iii) muscle soreness and recovery from exercise, and (iv) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and collagen synthesis. The results indicated that COL is most beneficial in improving joint functionality and reducing joint pain. Certain improvements in body composition, strength and muscle recovery were present. Collagen synthesis rates were elevated with 15 g/day COL but did not have a significant impact on MPS when compared to isonitrogenous higher quality protein sources. Exact mechanisms for these adaptations are unclear, with future research using larger sample sizes, elite athletes, female participants and more precise outcome measures such as muscle biopsies and magnetic imagery.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, clinical study on the effectiveness of collagen peptide on osteoarthritis.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen peptides show potential as effective nutritional supplements for managing osteoarthritis and maintaining joint health.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Recent studies show that enzymatically hydrolysed collagen, the collagen peptide, is absorbed and distributed to joint tissues and has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial with collagen peptides isolated from pork skin (PCP) and bovine bone (BCP) sources was carried out to study the effectiveness of orally supplemented collagen peptide to control the progression of osteoarthritis in patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. Improvement in treatment was assessed with reduction in Western Ontario McMaster Universities (WOMAC), visual analogue scale (VAS) and quality of life (QOL) scores from baseline to 13 weeks (Visit 7). Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

RESULTS
There was significant reduction from baseline to Visit 7 in the primary end points of WOMAC and VAS scores and in the secondary end point of QOL score in subjects with PCP and BCP groups, while in subjects with placebo group the end point indices remained unaltered. Furthermore, all the score levels of WOMAC, VAS and QOL decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the study group compared to placebo group in Visit 7.

CONCLUSION
The study demonstrated that collagen peptides are potential therapeutic agents as nutritional supplements for the management of osteoarthritis and maintenance of joint health.

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation improves skin elasticity, hydration, and wrinkle reduction, while supporting joint health by promoting cartilage regeneration and reducing inflammation.

Abstract:Introduction 
Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in the human body and the most prevalent component of the extracellular matrix. It provides mechanical support and guides tissue development. It is fundamental in maintaining elasticity, hydration, and overall structural integrity of the skin. Collagen is also essential for joint health, contributing to cartilage resilience and mobility. However, natural collagen synthesis declines with age, exacerbated by environmental factors such as UV radiation, environmental factors, lifestyle, and oxidative stress, leading to visible skin ageing and joint degeneration. 
Methods and Materials 
This study utilises data from databases such as PubMed, Frontiers, and Google Scholar to analyse the effectiveness of collagen supplementation in improving skin and joint health. A systematic review of clinical trials and in vitro studies was conducted to explore mechanisms of action, bioavailability, and outcomes associated with various forms of collagen supplementation. 
Conclusions 
Evidence indicates that hydrolysed collagen improves skin elasticity, hydration, and wrinkle reduction by stimulating fibroblast activity. Additionally, it supports joint health by promoting cartilage regeneration and reducing inflammation, particularly in conditions like osteoarthritis. The evidence for the positive impact of supplementing good quality collagen on the condition of the skin and musculoskeletal system is increasing. Further research into long-term effects and personalised supplementation strategies is necessary to optimise clinical outcomes.

Comparative Analysis of Collagen Supplementation Forms and Their Effects on Multiple Health Parameters

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation, particularly hydrolyzed collagen peptides, offers significant therapeutic potential for improving skin, joint, and musculoskeletal health.

Abstract:Collagen, a key structural protein, is essential for maintaining the integrity of connective tissues such as skin, cartilage, tendons, bones. As natural collagen production decreases with age and is further compromised by environmental factors such as UV radiation and poor diet, collagen degradation accelerates, leading to conditions like wrinkles, joint stiffness, and decreased bone density. Collagen supplementation has gained widespread attention as a therapeutic intervention to counteract these effects. This review conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various forms of collagen supplementation, including hydrolyzed collagen, undenatured collagen, and gelatin, and their effects on a range of health outcomes. Hydrolyzed collagen, due to enhanced bioavailability, is associated with improvements in skin elasticity, hydration, joint pain relief, and muscle recovery, making it particularly valuable for aging populations and athletes. Undenatured type II collagen, on the other hand, modulates immune responses and shows potential in reducing inflammation and slowing the progression of degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Gelatin, while less bioavailable than hydrolyzed collagen, still supports skin and joint health when taken in larger quantities. This review also explores emerging evidence of collagen’s beneficial effects on bone density, wound healing, and hair health, with marine-derived collagen showing promise in skin health due to its rapid absorption. Potential adverse effects, including mild gastrointestinal discomfort and rare allergic reactions, are discussed, emphasizing the importance of sourcing high-quality products. Overall, collagen supplementation, particularly hydrolyzed collagen peptides, offers significant therapeutic potential for improving skin, joint, and musculoskeletal health, but further research is required to define optimal dosages, formulations, and long-term safety for various populations.

The Impact of Oral Collagen Supplementation on Joint Function, Muscle Recovery, and Musculoskeletal Health in Athletes: A Narrative Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral collagen supplementation improves joint stability, reduces pain, and accelerates recovery in athletes, with combined use of resistance training enhancing muscle strength, body composition, and recovery markers.

Abstract:The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effects of oral collagen supplementation on joint function, muscle recovery, and overall musculoskeletal health in athletes. Collagen, a key protein in the body, is essential for the health of joints, muscles, and connective tissues. As collagen production declines with age, supplementation has become a promising strategy for improving athletic performance and reducing injury risk. This review analysed recent studies published from 2016 onwards, focusing on the impact of collagen supplementation, particularly in combination with regular training. The research involved a comprehensive literature search in the MEDLINE database, initially identifying 82 records, with 39 undergoing quality assessment. Ultimately, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The findings indicate that collagen peptides significantly enhance joint stability, reduce pain, and accelerate recovery from injuries such as Achilles tendinopathy. Moreover, collagen supplementation combined with resistance training was shown to improve muscle strength, body composition, and recovery markers more effectively than training alone. The review also highlights collagen's role in extracellular matrix remodelling and anti-inflammatory responses, offering potential benefits in tissue repair and injury prevention. These results suggest that collagen supplementation could be a valuable addition to athletes' training regimens, warranting further research to optimize dosing strategies and explore its mechanisms of action.

Key takeaways:Hydrolysed collagen intake helps reduce joint pain, bone density loss, and skin ageing, making it a promising long-term treatment for bone and joint degenerative diseases and preventing skin aging.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION
Hydrolysate Collagen (HC) consists of small peptides with a molecular weight lower than 5.000 Da. produced from gelatinization and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of native collagen which is found in rich collagenic animal tissues. There is much evidence about the HC ingestion positive effect over degenerative joint and bones diseases.

OBJECTIVE
The aim of this article is to review the present scientific studies about HC and to evaluate the HC ingestion therapeutical effects on some collagenic tissues as cartilage, bones and skin.

RESULTS
Up to date, there are more than 60 scientific studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinics and on bioavailability) about HC ingestion efficacy on reducing collagen damage and loss consequences as joint pain and erosion (osteoarthritis), bone density loss (osteoporosis) and skin ageing.

CONCLUSIONS
Preclinical studies show that HC stimulates collagenic tissue regeneration by increasing not only collagen synthesis but minor components (glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronic acid) synthesis as well. Clinical studies show that HC continual ingestion helps to reduce and prevent joint pain, bone density loss and skin ageing. These results as well as its high level of tolerance and safety make HC ingestion attractive for a long-term use in bone and joint degenerative diseases and in fight against skin ageing.

Key takeaways:Collagen-based medication is useful in treating comorbid diseases and preventing complications, particularly in skin regeneration, bone defects, sarcopenia, wound healing, dental therapy, gastroesophageal reflux, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Abstract:Collagen, an abundant extracellular matrix protein, has been found to have a lot of pharmaceuticals, medicine, food, and cosmetics applications. Increased knowledge of collagen sources, extraction techniques, structure, and properties in the last decades has helped develop more collagen-based products and tissue engineering biomaterials. Collagen products have been playing an important role in benefiting the health of the human body, especially for aging people. In this paper, the effects of collagen treatment in different clinical studies including skin regeneration, bone defects, sarcopenia, wound healing, dental therapy, gastroesophageal reflux, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis have been reviewed. The collagen treatments were significant in these clinical studies. In addition, the associations between these diseases were discussed. The comorbidity of these diseases might be closely related to collagen deficiency, and collagen treatment might be a good choice when a patient has more than one of these diseases, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It concludes that collagen-based medication is useful in treating comorbid diseases and preventing complications.

Key takeaways:Collagen has both arthritogenic and anti-arthritogenic effects, and understanding these contradictory effects can help develop potential therapeutic applications for arthritis treatment.

Abstract:In biology, collagen-biomaterial regulates several signaling mechanisms of bone and immune cells involved in tissue repair and any imbalance in collagen turnover may affect the homeostasis of cells, becoming a major cause of several complications. In this case, the administration of oral collagen may play a potential role in returning cells to their normal function. For several decades, the beneficial effects of collagen have been explored widely, and thus many commercial products are available in cosmetics, food, and biomedical fields. For instance, collagen-based-products have been widely used to treat the complications of cartilage-related-disorders. Many researchers are reporting the anti-arthritogenic properties of collagen-based materials. In contrast, collagen, especially type-II collagen (CII), has been widely used to induce arthritis by immunization in an animal-model with or without adjuvants, and the potentially immunogenic-properties of collagen have been continuously reported for a long time. Additionally, the immune tolerance of collagen is mainly regulated by the T-lymphocytes and B-cells. This controversial hypothesis is getting more and more evidence nowadays from both sides to support its mechanism. Therefore, this review links the gap between the arthritogenic and anti-arthritogenic effects of collagen and explored the actual mechanism to understand the fundamental concept of collagen in arthritis. Accordingly, this review opens-up several unrevealed scientific knots of collagen and arthritis and helps the researchers understand the potential use of collagen in therapeutic applications.

Collagen supplementation - does it bring real benefits?

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation can improve skin quality, increase hydration, delay aging, treat osteoarthritis, and potentially prevent cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract:Collagen is a protein and one of the main building blocks of our skin. It is found in bones, tendons, ligaments, internal organs, blood vessels, and the lining of the intestines. In our body, collagen enables the cohesion of tissues and organs, affects hydration, resistance and elasticity of the skin, reduces the risk of developing degenerative joint diseases. Its production decreases with age. As a result, more and more people are taking collagen supplements. It has been proven that doing so can bring many benefits to the body. Taking collagen orally can be an effective way to improve the quality of the skin, increase hydration and delay the aging process. Collagen peptides are potential therapeutic agents for treating osteoarthritis and maintaining joint health. Collagen supplementation may be an element of preventive medicine in the field of cardiovascular diseases. as it significantly reduces fat mass and increases lean mass, it also leads to lower LDL concentrations. A beneficial effect was also noted on hair and nails, as well as on brain function.

Abstract:Collagen, the most abundant protein in our bodies, plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of various tissues and organs. Beyond its involvement in skin elasticity and joint health, emerging research suggests that collagen may significantly impact the treatment of complex diseases, particularly those associated with tissue damage and inflammation. The versatile functions of collagen, including skin regeneration, improving joint health, and increasing bone strength, make it potentially useful in treating different diseases. To the best of my knowledge, the strategy of using collagen to treat comorbid diseases has not been widely studied. This paper aims to explore the potential of collagen in treating comorbid diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, psoriatic arthritis, sarcopenia, gastroesophageal reflux, periodontitis, skin aging, and diabetes mellitus. Collagen-based therapies have shown promise in managing comorbidities due to their versatile properties. The multifaceted nature of collagen positions it as a promising candidate for treating complex diseases and addressing comorbid conditions. Its roles in wound healing, musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular health, and gastrointestinal conditions highlight the diverse therapeutic applications of collagen in the context of comorbidity management.

Enzymatic Hydrolysis of a Collagen Hydrolysate Enhances Postprandial Absorption Rate—A Randomized Controlled Trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:Enzymatic hydrolysis of collagen hydrolysates increases the absorption rate and bioavailability of beneficial amino acids glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline.

Abstract:Collagen is characterized by its high content of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, and is found to exert beneficial effects on joint pain related to activity and osteoarthritis. However, to exert any beneficial effects it is essential that collagen is optimally absorbed. This study aimed to investigate the postprandial absorption of collagen and elucidate the impact of an exogenous enzymatic hydrolysis on absorption rate and bioavailability. A randomized, blinded, cross-over study was conducted where ten healthy male subjects received either 35 g enzymatically hydrolyzed collagen protein (EHC), 35 g non-enzymatically hydrolyzed collagen protein (NC) or placebo (250 mL water) on three nonconsecutive days. Blood samples were drawn before, and up to 240 min following, ingestion and the blood metabolome was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. A significant increase in the plasma concentration of nearly all amino acids (AAs) was observed over a 240 min period for both EHC and NC. In addition, the absorption rate and bioavailability of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline were significantly higher for EHC (p < 0.05). In conclusion, ingestion of collagen hydrolysates increases postprandial plasma concentrations of AAs over a period of 240 min, and an enzymatic hydrolysis increases the absorption rate and bioavailability of the collagen-rich AAs glycine, proline and hydroxyproline.

Collagen supplementation for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation may help reduce joint pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but it's important to consider other factors like vitamin C, age, and collagen-related food intake.

Abstract:Dear Editor, We read with great interest the article by Jabbari et al. on the role of collagen supplementation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA).1 We appreciate the authors' valuable contribution to this comprehensive systematic review; however, we would like to highlight some key points. First, although the authors extracted information on different types of collagen such as intact, hydrolyzed, type I and type II collagen was extracted, there was a lack of details on residual confounders such as concurrent vitamin C (Vit C) supplementation. Vit C plays a crucial role in the absorption and production of collagen in the human body and its deficiency can affect the formation of a mature collagen network.2,3 Specifically, maintaining a normal mature collagen network in humans depends on the antiscurvy properties of Vit C, which prevent the autoinactivation of the two key enzymes in collagen biosynthesis, lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase.2 Age and collagenrelated food intake or nutritional support,4 which can influence the rate and amount of collagen production, are also significant residual confounders that should be considered.5 Likewise, effect measure modification by common comorbidities or risk factors for RA and OA of inflammatory or autoimmune conditions,6,7 including psoriasis,8,9 psoriatic arthritis,10,11 spondyloarthritis,12 irritable bowel syndrome,13 periodontitis or other oral diseases,7,1421

Is collagen supplementation friend or foe in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis? A comprehensive systematic review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen supplementation may have high adverse effects and low efficiency in treating OA and RA patients, making it difficult to definitively determine its beneficial or detrimental effects.

Abstract:Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) both are chronic diseases affecting joints. Immune response against collagen in both diseases may have a role in the initiation and progression of the disease. There is a hypothesis that suppression of immune response vs collagen could be a therapeutic approach in RA and OA. Exposure of gut immune system to collagen is a way to suppress immune response against collagen in the joints. So, the current systematic review is aimed to evaluate the effects of collagen supplementation in OA and RA patients. In the current systematic review, online electronic databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Sciences and Scopus were searched and finally 19 articles were included. The enrolled articles evaluated the effects of collagen supplementation on treatment of OA (n = 9) and RA (n = 10). Intact (n = 4) and hydrolyzed (n = 5) collagen were used to treat OA. All of the studies on RA used intact and type II collagen in their intervention. The last trials on collagen supplementation in RA and OA patients were performed in 2011 and 2016, respectively. High adverse effects of collagen supplementation and its low efficiency compared to routine treatments were reported by several included studies. Also, risk of bias assessment showed that most of the studies had poor quality. Therefore, it is not possible to definitely decide on the beneficial or detrimental effects of collagen supplementation on OA and RA patients. Further studies are needed to reach a final decision.

Collagen VI in the Musculoskeletal System

Key takeaways:Collagen VI plays a crucial role in the musculoskeletal system, with mutations in its genes leading to various muscular disorders.

Abstract:Collagen VI exerts several functions in the tissues in which it is expressed, including mechanical roles, cytoprotective functions with the inhibition of apoptosis and oxidative damage, and the promotion of tumor growth and progression by the regulation of cell differentiation and autophagic mechanisms. Mutations in the genes encoding collagen VI main chains, COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3, are responsible for a spectrum of congenital muscular disorders, namely Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD), Bethlem myopathy (BM) and myosclerosis myopathy (MM), which show a variable combination of muscle wasting and weakness, joint contractures, distal laxity, and respiratory compromise. No effective therapeutic strategy is available so far for these diseases; moreover, the effects of collagen VI mutations on other tissues is poorly investigated. The aim of this review is to outline the role of collagen VI in the musculoskeletal system and to give an update about the tissue-specific functions revealed by studies on animal models and from patients’ derived samples in order to fill the knowledge gap between scientists and the clinicians who daily manage patients affected by collagen VI-related myopathies.

Molecular bases of collagen-based compounds’ action mechanisms

Number of 

Key takeaways:Injectable collagen can speed up recovery, promote repair, and reduce pain in musculoskeletal disorders by improving fibroblast response and neosynthesis.

Abstract:In the field of functional tissue engineering collagen represents an interesting option when site-specifically injected since it acts as a bio-scaffold replacing, supporting, reinforcing, protecting connective tissues but also stimulating the neo-synthesis of collagen.
Given these characteristics, the use of injectable collagen for the clinical management of musculo-skeletal disorders due to overuse, aging, injuries can be recommended to:
• speed up of functional recovery timing,
• induction of repair, remodelling, and regeneration processes,
• secondary pain control.
The main action mechanism of injectable collagen is related to mechanotrasduction properties: Injections of tropocollagen improve tensile characteristics of the extracellular matrix which surround fibroblasts and improves fibroblasts’ mechanical response speeding up the neosynthesis of collagen and inducing the proliferation of fibroblasts themselves. This mechanism of action has been studied and verified through studies, on ex vivo cellular models which provided data on the ability of swine type 1 tropocollagen to control tissue degeneration and improve the structural characteristics of the tissue.

The role of injectable collagen therapy in the three-stage treatment concept

Number of 

Key takeaways:Injection collagen therapy is an effective and safe treatment for musculoskeletal system pathologies when combined with targeted rehabilitation, improving mobility and reducing pain.

Abstract:Injection collagen therapy is a new therapeutic tool in medicine. Various injection techniques are used, from mesotherapy (local intradermal therapy – LIT), intramuscular injections to intra-articular injections. Based on the conducted researches, this method seems to be effective and safe. This therapy is used in pathologies of the musculoskeletal system (degenerative disease, enthesopathies, tendinopathies and others). In addition, collagen injection therapy is used in spinal pathologies, especially those of a myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). However, as a tool alone it may not be sufficient. Therefore, in relation to the three-stage treatment concept it may prove to be more effective. The three-stage concept of treating pathologies of the musculoskeletal system consists of:
• assessment of risk factors, their reduction and/or modification,
• implementation of targeted medical therapy, in this case collagen injection therapy, and then
• implementation of targeted rehabilitation at the appropriate time.
Injection collagen therapy activates repair mechanisms. It restores the correct tension in the soft tissues (muscles, fascia, ligaments), which are often subject to increased tension in the course of various pathologies of the musculoskeletal system. As a result, mobility improves and pain is reduced. Based on clinical experience to date, this regimen provides satisfactory results. However, further researches are required.

The impact of collagen protein ingestion on musculoskeletal connective tissue remodeling: a narrative review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Dietary collagen consumption may stimulate connective tissue remodeling, improving health and functional performance.

Abstract:Abstract Collagen is the central structural component of extracellular connective tissue, which provides elastic qualities to tissues. For skeletal muscle, extracellular connective tissue transmits contractile force to the tendons and bones. Connective tissue proteins are in a constant state of remodeling and have been shown to express a high level of plasticity. Dietary-protein ingestion increases muscle protein synthesis rates. High-quality, rapidly digestible proteins are generally considered the preferred protein source to maximally stimulate myofibrillar (contractile) protein synthesis rates. In contrast, recent evidence demonstrates that protein ingestion does not increase muscle connective tissue protein synthesis. The absence of an increase in muscle connective tissue protein synthesis after protein ingestion may be explained by insufficient provision of glycine and/or proline. Dietary collagen contains large amounts of glycine and proline and, therefore, has been proposed to provide the precursors required to facilitate connective tissue protein synthesis. This literature review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current knowledge on the proposed benefits of dietary collagen consumption to stimulate connective tissue remodeling to improve health and functional performance.

Key takeaways:Oral collagen supplementation improves skin elasticity, hydration, and joint mobility, while reducing pain and increasing joint range of motion in osteoarthritis patients.

Abstract:IntroductionCollagen is a protein that has found widespread use both as an ingredient in cosmetics applied externally and as an oral supplement. This substance is obtained from a number of animal sources, including bovine tissues, as well as marine fish. The characteristic properties of collagen peptides, such as scientifically proven anti-inflammatory effects, activation of fibroblast skin cells, stimulation of synovial cells to produce hyaluronic acid, and much more make this type of supplement promising in improving the body's general condition and in alleviating the symptoms of many ailments. Numerous scientific studies have shown that supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen has a beneficial effect on both the overall condition of the skin by improving its elasticity, hydration level, and positive action on its protective barrier and on the musculoskeletal system, where, when combined with appropriately selected physical activity, it can help to reduce pain associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis and even increase the range of movement in the joints. Easy availability, user-friendly forms of administration, such as powders or ready-to-drink liquid formulations, and a low incidence of side effects make this supplementation highly beneficial for users.  Aim of the studyThis study aims to discuss the known processes and review the evidence supporting the beneficial effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on the human skin and musculoskeletal system.Material and methodThis article presents the current state of knowledge about the benefits of oral collagen peptide supplementation in various scientific articles. Publications describing the mechanisms of action and the effects of collagen supplementation on skin conditions and the musculoskeletal system, including recent reports in this field, were reviewed using the PubMed platform. The search included the keywords ‘collagen’, ‘collagen supplementation’, ‘nutritional supplement’, ‘recovery’

Hydrolyzed marine collagen in complex therapy of degenerative-dystrophic changes in the mustocular system

Number of 

Key takeaways:Hydrolyzed marine collagen, along with vitamins, microelements, and Promerim®, optimizes the prevention and treatment of degenerative changes in the musculoskeletal system.

Abstract:Degenerative-dystrophic changes in the musculoskeletal system of various localizations are one of the most common reasons for patients to turn not only to a rheumatologist, but also to a neurologist and first-contact doctors (therapist and general practitioner) who provide primary health care. Medicines that modify the symptoms of degenerative-dystrophic changes in the musculoskeletal system are divided into “fast-acting” (analgesics, NSAIDs, tramadol) and “slow-acting” (chondroprotectors). When considering “slow-acting” drugs, many publications are devoted to the natural components of the cartilage intercellular substance – glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, while much less attention is paid to the importance of collagen. In articular cartilage, collagens provide most of the biomechanical properties of the extracellular matrix necessary for its function. Collagen hydrolysates have demonstrated positive results in clinical trials related to joint health, such as reducing joint pain, increasing mobility, and improving joint structure. Marine collagen is the closest in molecular structure to human collagen fibers. Its main characteristics include high biological activity and biocompatibility, as well as low antigenicity. The possible effects of vitamin C, vitamin D3, zinc and calcium in the complex treatment of degenerative-dystrophic changes in the musculoskeletal system are considered. A biological supplement containing vitamins, microelements and hydrolyzed marine collagen Promerim® optimizes the prevention and treatment of patients with degenerative changes in the musculoskeletal system.

Vitamin C-enriched gelatin supplementation before intermittent activity augments collagen synthesis.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Vitamin C-enriched gelatin supplementation before intermittent exercise improves collagen synthesis, potentially aiding in injury prevention and tissue repair.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Musculoskeletal injuries are the most common complaint in active populations. More than 50% of all injuries in sports can be classified as sprains, strains, ruptures, or breaks of musculoskeletal tissues. Nutritional and/or exercise interventions that increase collagen synthesis and strengthen these tissues could have an important effect on injury rates.

OBJECTIVE
This study was designed to determine whether gelatin supplementation could increase collagen synthesis.

DESIGN
Eight healthy male subjects completed a randomized, double-blinded, crossover-design study in which they consumed either 5 or 15 g of vitamin C-enriched gelatin or a placebo control. After the initial drink, blood was taken every 30 min to determine amino acid content in the blood. A larger blood sample was taken before and 1 h after consumption of gelatin for treatment of engineered ligaments. One hour after the initial supplement, the subjects completed 6 min of rope-skipping to stimulate collagen synthesis. This pattern of supplementation was repeated 3 times/d with ≥6 h between exercise bouts for 3 d. Blood was drawn before and 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after the first exercise bout for determination of amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I content.

RESULTS
Supplementation with increasing amounts of gelatin increased circulating glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine, peaking 1 h after the supplement was given. Engineered ligaments treated for 6 d with serum from samples collected before or 1 h after subjects consumed a placebo or 5 or 15 g gelatin showed increased collagen content and improved mechanics. Subjects who took 15 g gelatin 1 h before exercise showed double the amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I in their blood, indicating increased collagen synthesis.

CONCLUSION
These data suggest that adding gelatin to an intermittent exercise program improves collagen synthesis and could play a beneficial role in injury prevention and tissue repair. This trial was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry as ACTRN12616001092482.

Collagen Peptide Supplementation and Musculoskeletal Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen peptide supplementation is ineffective in improving musculoskeletal performance in healthy adults when combined with exercise.

Abstract:Problem: There is a growing body of research investigating a variety of parameters affected by collagen peptide (CP) supplementation during structured exercise programs. The aim of this review is to focus on the musculoskeletal performance outcomes potentially affected by CP intake in healthy adults. Methods: A comprehensive literature search using defined MeSH terms was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO and Cochrane) by two independent reviewers. The resulting studies were used for systematic review and a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Two primary study objectives were identified, categorizing studies into those focusing on a potential effect of CP intake on adaptation to training stimuli and those focusing on recovery from training stimuli. Nine of these studies were used for in-depth meta-analysis. Of the 55 performance parameters extracted, 48 were unaffected by additional CP intake. Furthermore, the meta-analysis revealed no significant effect of CP on strength-related performance parameters (SMD=0.079 , p=0.445). Discussion: The studies included show a high degree of homogeneity in most methodological aspects and have a low risk of biased results, which supports the validity of the results found. Nevertheless, this result represents the current state of scientific knowledge. Conclusion: The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the available studies suggests the ineffectiveness of CP supplementation in addition to exercise to further improve musculoskeletal performance.

Injection collagen therapy in combination with other therapies – how and why?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Injection collagen therapy can be used alone or in combination with other therapies for various musculoskeletal system pathologies, with potential benefits for patients at risk.

Abstract:Injection collagen therapy is very often used as monotherapy in the course of various pathologies, including pathologies of the musculoskeletal system. In the treatment of musculoskeletal system pathologies, the following are also used: glucocorticosteroid (GC) therapy and platelet rich plasma (PRP) applied intraarticularly and peri-articularly, as well as hyaluronic acid therapy, mainly applied intra-articularly. The use of injectable collagen therapy is two-way:
• GC or PRP or hyaluronic acid are administered intra-articularly, and collagen therapy is used peri-articularly, i.e. different products in different areas, and
• GC and collagen or PRP and collagen, hyaluronic acid and collagen are used, e.g. intra-articularly, i.e. different products in one area.
Such injection regimens are often used in medical practice. It should be remembered that GC therapy is associated with side effects, especially in the group of geriatric patients with hypertension and diabetes. This allows for the use of lower doses of GCs in combination with injectable collagen with good therapeutic effect, especially in patients at risk.
There are more and more studies in the literature showing the efficacy and safety of injectable collagen therapy used alone or in combination with other preparations. However, this topic requires further prospective and observational studies.

An Update on the Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Collagen Injectables for Aesthetic and Regenerative Medicine Applications

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen-based injectables have shown clinical efficacy and safety in treating various soft tissue diseases, including integumental, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and urogenital apparatus.

Abstract:Soft tissues diseases significantly affect patients quality of life and usually require targeted, costly and sometimes constant interventions. With the average lifetime increase, a proportional increase of age-related soft tissues diseases has been witnessed. Due to this, the last two decades have seen a tremendous demand for minimally invasive one-step resolutive procedures. Intensive scientific and industrial research has led to the recognition of injectable formulations as a new advantageous approach in the management of complex diseases that are challenging to treat with conventional strategies. Among them, collagen-based products are revealed to be one of the most promising among bioactive biomaterials-based formulations. Collagen is the most abundant structural protein of vertebrate connective tissues and, because of its structural and non-structural role, is one of the most widely used multifunctional biomaterials in the health-related sectors, including medical care and cosmetics. Indeed, collagen-based formulations are historically considered as the “gold standard” and from 1981 have been paving the way for the development of a new generation of fillers. A huge number of collagen-based injectable products have been approved worldwide for clinical use and have routinely been introduced in many clinical settings for both aesthetic and regenerative surgery. In this context, this review article aims to be an update on the clinical outcomes of approved collagen-based injectables for both aesthetic and regenerative medicine of the last 20 years with an in-depth focus on their safety and effectiveness for the treatment of diseases of the integumental, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and urogenital apparatus.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fish-derived collagen hydrolysate from Mozambique tilapia scales improves hair and skin health by alleviating oxidative stress, promoting hair growth, and enhancing skin health, both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract:Fish-derived collagen hydrolysate (CH) has shown promise in improving hair and skin health. Therefore, this study sought to comprehensively assess the effects of CH extracted from Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) scales on hair and skin using in vitro and in vivo models. Human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) were used for antioxidant and gene expression analyses, while C57BL/6 mice were orally administered CH for six weeks to assess hair growth patterns. The mice were divided into four groups: negative control (NC; distilled water), positive control (PC; 1 mg/kg finasteride), CH500 (500 mg/kg BW CH), and CH1000 (1000 mg/kg BW CH). CH mitigated catalase activity reduction in hDPCs, increased IGF-1 and VEGF levels, and decreased TGF-β1, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression. In vivo, CH treatment improved hair growth index, length, diameter, weight, and density. Scanning electron microscopy revealed reduced hair damage. Moreover, CH up-regulated IGF-1, VEGF, Elastin, and HAS2 mRNA expression while down-regulating TNF-α and IL-1β. CH enhanced hair shine, growth, and skin health while alleviating inflammation. These findings demonstrate the potential of CH in alleviating oxidative stress, promoting hair growth, and enhancing skin health, both in vitro and in vivo. Fish-derived CH offers a cost-effective and bioavailable option for improving hair and skin health.

Abstract:Background Hydrolysed collagen supplements are reported to fight the signs of aging and improve skin appearance, but more authoritative clinical evidence is needed to support efficacy. Aim This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of a supplement containing hydrolysed collagen and vitamin C (Absolute Collagen, AC) on biophysical parameters and visible signs of aging for skin, scalp, and hair, when taken daily or every 48 hours. Methods We measured dermal collagen using confocal microscopy and high-resolution ultrasound. Hydration, elasticity, wrinkles, and clinical trichoscopy were measured in parallel to expert visual grading. Efficacy measures were recorded at baseline, week 6, and week 12. Results Following 12 weeks daily use of the AC supplement, using confocal microscopy, we observed a significant 44.6% decrease in fragmentation vs. placebo (p < 0.01). We also measured a change in the ultrasound LEP (low echogenic pixel) ratio comparing upper and lower dermis (−9.24 vs. −7.83, respectively, p=0.05), suggesting collagen improvements occurred more in the upper dermal compartment. After 12 weeks vs. placebo, skin hydration was increased by 13.8% (p < 0.01), R2 elasticity index was increased by 22.7% (p<0.01), and Rz profilometry index was decreased by 19.6% (p < 0.01). Trichoscopy showed an average 11.0% improvement in scalp scaling and a 27.6% increase in the total number of hairs counted vs. placebo (p=n.s.). This was associated with a 31.9% increase in clinical grading score for hair healthy appearance (p < 0.01). Conclusion The AC supplement has shown clinical benefits for skin, scalp, and hair, when used either daily or every 48 hours, over a 12-week period.

Key takeaways:Oral intake of Bioactive Collagen Peptides (BCP) significantly increases hair thickness and follicle cell proliferation compared to placebo.

Abstract:The effectiveness of supplementation with Bioactive Collagen Peptides (BCP) on the health and appearance of the skin and nails has been proven in several clinical trials. The influence of BCP supplementation on hair, however, has not been investigated to the same extent. In this placebo-controlled study, therefore, the effects of BCP intake on hair thickness and metabolism were investigated. The study was conducted on 44 healthy women aged between 39 and 75, who each received a daily dosage of 2.5 g BCP or placebo. After a treatment period of 16 weeks, hair thickness was determined and compared with the thickness at the beginning of the trial. In addition, the proliferation rate of human hair follicle cells that had been exposed to BCP was examined and the results compared with untreated control cells. The data showed a statistically significant (p<0.01) increase in the cell proliferation rate of 31% compared to the controls. The measurement of hair thickness showed a statistically significant (p<0.01) increase in the BCP group compared to placebo. Over the course of the collagen peptide treatment, hair thickness increased significantly by 1.93 ± 0.42 μm (p<0.01), whereas a slight decrease in hair thickness of -0.99 ± 0.40 μm (p=0.07) was measured in the placebo group. This clearly demonstrates the positive effect of BCP treatment on hair thickness and follicle cell proliferation.

A Nutritional Supplement Formulated with Peptides, Lipids, Collagen andHyaluronic Acid Optimizes Key Aspects of Physical Appearance in Nails,Hair and Skin

Number of 

Key takeaways:A nutritional supplement containing peptides, lipids, hyaluronic acid, and collagen significantly improves hair, skin, and nails, making it an important and necessary component of complete hair, nail, and skin care regimens.

Abstract:Symptoms of dryness in the skin, hair and nails increase with age, and with certain medical, environmental and physiologic conditions—affecting a significant portion of the population. Topical therapies can be limited by the skin’s inherent barrier function, and simply ingesting a balanced and varied diet may not be enough to prevent nutritional deficiencies. The authors describe two double-blinded, placebo vs. control clinical studies, including one 60-week cross-over study, on the effect of a nutritional supplement formulation on hair, skin, and nails. The supplement formulation, that contained peptides, lipids, hyaluronic acid, and collagen as its active ingredients, was given to participants in 20- gram oral doses once daily, and the results show the magnitude of its effectiveness. The data showed statistically significant improvement in nail cracking, nail brittleness, hair dullness, hair dryness, and nail softness after 8 weeks. There was a significant decrease in skin dryness over the same period. The crossover study showed that those receiving the supplement had statistically significant benefits for as long as 52 weeks, then when the cross-over was performed and the supplement was withdrawn, there was a significant decline in benefits. Of those subjects with more severe symptoms at the outset, 95% saw significant improvement in hair dryness and dullness, 85% in nail splitting and peeling, and 65% in nail hardness. The authors conclude that this nutritional supplementation should be considered as an important, effective and perhaps necessary component of complete hair, nail and skin care regimens.

Key takeaways:Collagen-containing cosmetic products improve skin condition and delay aging by reducing wrinkles, hydration, and TEWL, and reducing nail breakage.

Abstract:Collagen (CLG) belongs to the family of fibrillar proteins and is composed of left-handed α polypeptide chains, which, twisting around themselves and their axis, form a right-handed superhelix. In the chemical structure, it contains mainly proline, hydroxyproline, glycine, and hydroxylysine. It occurs naturally in the dermis in the form of fibers that provide the skin with proper density and elasticity. The review aimed to present the types of collagen protein, factors affecting its structure and its unusual role in the functioning of the human body. Also, an overview of cosmetic products containing collagen or its derivatives, the characteristics of the formulas of these products, and the effects of their use were presented. Throughout the market, there are many cosmetic and cosmeceutical products containing CLG. They are in the form of fillers administered as injections, belonging to the group of the oldest tissue fillers; products administered orally and for topical use, such as creams, gels, serums, or cosmetic masks. Analyzed studies have shown that the use of products with collagen or its peptides improves the general condition of the skin and delays the aging process by reducing the depth of wrinkles, improving hydration (in the case of oral preparations), reducing transepithelial water loss (TEWL), as well as improving skin density and elasticity. In addition, oral application of bioactive CLG peptides has shown a positive effect on the nails, reducing the frequency of their breakage.

Skin collagen through the lifestages: importance for skin health and beauty

Number of 

Key takeaways:Collagen-based supplements can rejuvenate ageing or damaged skin, improve joint function, and support personal wellbeing, offering potential anti-aging strategies.

Abstract:Collagen-based supplements have become a keystone in the management of the ageing process, with proven ability to repair skin damage, bestowing a youthful and healthy appearance sought in the pursuit of beauty. Collagen is an essential scaffold protein that gives smoothness and elasticity to skin, but its production declines with age. Finding ways to tackle this problem is now strongly promoted as an effective way to transform skin and hair, repairing age-related deterioration. A growing number of scientific studies show exciting evidence that it is possible to rejuvenate ageing or damaged skin, improve function of worn joints, and support personal wellbeing and vitality. In recent times, research on the mechanisms which impact the production of collagen in skin and the ideal organization into functional fibres which give skin its characteristic elasticity and firmness has provided new insights into how this bio-scaffold can support cells, tissues and organs. The factors which influence collagen production over a lifetime (e.g., puberty, pregnancy, menopause, andropause), intrinsic factors (e.g., genetics, age, ethnicity) and extrinsic factors (e.g., UV-radiation, pollution, smoking) and the potential for new technologies, ingredients and devices to restore collagen and matrix components to their optimal condition are improving the ability to deliver anti-aging strategies with unprecedented results. This paper will review skin collagen production, structure and function throughout the lifestages, emphasizing its relationship with health, appearance and beauty.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral intake of 5g/day of collagen peptides significantly improves skin conditions and increases hair strength, particularly for aged hair.

Abstract:The effect of collagen peptides on various aspects of skin and hair physiology is known but needs further studies. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical changes in skin and hair after 90 days of treatment with oral supplementation of 5 g/day of collagen peptides. For this, 60 healthy female participants were enrolled, aged 45 to 60 years old, with the primary objective of evaluating the effect of the ingestion of a bioactive collagen peptides-based supplementation in the cutaneous microrelief, reduction of wrinkles, thickness, and echogenicity of the dermis, as well as in the mechanical properties of the hair using biophysical and skin imaging techniques. The present study showed important benefits in relevant skin visual parameters, dermis density, and hair strength with the obtained data. In addition, considering that the aging process affects the hair's mechanical resistance due to hair fiber thinner, the proposed treatment was effective for aged hair. In conclusion, the collagen peptides oral supplementation is essential not only for improving skin conditions but also for hair care once it significantly increases the mechanical hair resistance evaluated by objective measurements.

Effects of Oral Collagen for Skin Anti-Aging: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Hydrolyzed collagen supplementation significantly improves skin hydration and elasticity, but further large-scale trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract:This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1721 patients to assess the effects of hydrolyzed collagen (HC) supplementation on skin hydration and elasticity. The results showed that HC supplementation significantly improved skin hydration (test for overall effect: Z = 4.94, p < 0.00001) and elasticity (test for overall effect: Z = 4.49, p < 0.00001) compared to the placebo group. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the effects of HC supplementation on skin hydration varied based on the source of collagen and the duration of supplementation. However, there were no significant differences in the effects of different sources (p = 0.21) of collagen or corresponding measurements (p = 0.06) on skin elasticity. The study also identified several biases in the included RCTs. Overall, the findings suggest that HC supplementation can have positive effects on skin health, but further large-scale randomized control trials are necessary to confirm these findings.

In the United States it is estimated that approximately 50% of the adult population use such supplements, at a cost exceeding $30 billion annually. Recently a host of such supplements have emerged aimed exclusively at improving skin appearance. Undoubtedly, proper nutrition leads to healthy-looking skin, hair, and nails, and the reverse is true. The extracellular matrix of the integumental tissues—composed mainly of collagen, proteoglycans, elastin, and keratin—results from the proper function of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Like all other cells in our body, they rely on the availability of precursors of such molecules as well as cofactors, minerals, and vitamins that support cellular activity. There is no reason to believe that cells in the integument are different than other somatic cells in this connection. A rapidly emerging fallacy is the assumption that consuming collagen, the structural protein that composes more than 30% of all our proteins, or its denatured derivative, gelatin, or related polypeptides, can enhance the synthesis and deposition of new molecules in the dermis, a structure that loses significant mass with age. Hair and nails, also targeted by these products, contain no collagen but an unrelated structural protein, keratin. As a consequence, collagen, gelatin, or derived peptides in the form of tablets, capsules, drinks, and candies are flooding the market. Several million entries in the Internet are related in one way or another to this event, reflecting the extent of this assumption. It is almost reminiscent of the thinking of the Dark Ages: If you want to be smart, eat brain; if you want courage, eat heart. And now the thinking has evolved to the following: If you want a beautiful appearance, consume the major protein component of the skin: collagen or its denatured form, gelatin, or derived peptides. Based on our current knowledge, it would be apparent that ingesting small amounts of collagen, a protein that is among the lowest in nutritional value, in its native form or after it has been denatured by heating or hydrolyzed into peptides can never achieve the objective of generating any significant amount of new collagen in tissues. A unique amino acid present in collagen, hydroxyproline, cannot be reused tomake new collagen. It has to be actively incorporated into the nascent polypeptide as proline and then posttranslationally modified into hydroxyproline before it can be incorporated into the collagen molecule, which is then assembled into the classic collagen fibers that act as a scaffold for all our connective tissues (skin, bone, cartilage, blood vessels, ligaments). This has been known for more than 60 years. In spite of this reality, several publications of dubious merit have implied that collagen synthesis is enhanced in patients consuming collagen supplements. Concomitantly, it has been claimed that changes in parameters such as skin hydration and texture are improved. In one study sponsored by a gelatin processing company that provided collagen-derived dipeptides, such as prolyl-hydroxyproline among others, water retention increased and changes in gene expression reversed in hairless mice consuming a magnesiumand zinc-deficient diet. The reality is that it is hyaluronic acid that actually retains water in tissues, not collagen. Almost 100 products making similar claims are actively marketed in the absence of any scientifically acceptable rationale. Most often, supportive studies such as these are funded directly or indirectly by entities that manufacture or distribute related products. It is unlikely that independent research institutions, even those working in the same field, can ever be in the position to divert funds and efforts to validate or refute these findings, particularly if they are widely acknowledged as inaccurate. Unfortunately, this often allows highly dubious or incorrect findings to remain unchallenged. It is a fact that collagen hydrolysates manufactured in the laboratory will generate peptides that are similar to those generated in the intestinal tract whenwe consume gelatinor collagen-containing foods. In addition, they can all be further modified by intestinal enzymes. Governments or foundations would never provide funds to perform or reproduce this work because lack of feasibility has already been well established and reported in the literature over the years. Consequently, we are left with biased and selective observations that are never independently confirmed. This is true not only for the products discussed here, so readily identifiable, but for many substances that are available as dietary supplements. Many are valuable, associated with significant scientific observations, and reproduced in many settings; others, like those discussed here, are not. I believe that as scientists andmedical professionals, we have the duty to support valuable information and products that have the potential to benefit humanity. We should engage in research studies with solid scientific merit and potential to improve quality of life and be openly critical of those that do not meet such standards.

Key takeaways:Corvina fish scale collagen has a higher protein content (67%), while all three treatments yield similar collagen quality, making it a suitable source for maintaining skin, nails, and hair firmness.

Abstract:In recent years, collagen has become important in our diet to maintain firmness and flexibility in our skin, nails and hair. In the present work, natural collagen was obtained from of fish scales of “cachema” ( Cynoscion analis ), “bonito” ( Sarda chiliensis ) y “corvina” ( Cilus gilberti). The species were selected for being the best-selling in the popular markets of the city, they were bought and washed and then extracted the scales with the help of a serrated knife, the scales were dried at room temperatura and sterilized at 80°C about 30 minutes in dry steam. To obtain collagen, the scales were hydrated and then pulverized by mechanical method. This procedure consisted of placing the scales in a pot with 1 liter of water, then boiling for about 30 minutes, finally it was liquefied and sieved. The product obtained was stored at 4°C, and was subjected to analysis of organoleptic characteristics and protein content by Kjeldahl method. It is concluded that there is not difference in flavor, texture and aroma, between the collagen obtained in the three treatments, but the protein content is higher in “corvina” (67%).
