The impact of eating right before bedtime on metabolism, sleep, and recovery

Eating right before bedtime, especially large and high-calorie meals, may negatively affect metabolism, sleep quality, and the body's regenerative processes. Late-night eating is associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and sleep disorders, which consequently impacts health and longevity. At the same time, small, nutritious snacks consumed before bedtime can support muscle recovery, particularly in physically active individuals, provided that heavy and sweet foods are avoided in the evening.

Level of evidence:Good

Late eating disrupts the body's natural circadian and hormonal rhythms, leading to higher nighttime levels of glucose and insulin and reduced fat burning. Such metabolic changes promote energy storage and the development of metabolic syndrome. Additionally, heavy and highly processed evening snacks can cause discomfort and disrupt sleep quality, increasing the frequency of awakenings. Conversely, light, protein-based snacks support muscle protein synthesis and recovery, especially when an appropriate time gap between eating and sleeping is maintained.

Eating right before bedtime, especially in the form of large, heavy, or sweet meals, is associated with a negative impact on metabolism and sleep quality. Disrupted circadian rhythms, increased insulin and glucose levels, reduced fat burning, and increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome indicate significant harm from this practice. However, small, light, and nutritious snacks eaten in moderation may have minimal or neutral health impact.

Eating meals right before bedtime is common, which means that the potential negative consequences have broad health significance. The high prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the population makes limiting evening eating a potentially significant health benefit at the population level.

Avoid large meals before bedtime

Have your last main meal at least 3 hours before planned sleep to support proper metabolism and sleep.

Choose light and nutritious snacks

If you need to eat in the evening, choose a small portion of protein or low-calorie products that support recovery, e.g., natural yogurt or cottage cheese.

Maintain a regular daily rhythm

Try to consume most calories in the first half of the day and keep consistent meal times to support the body’s natural circadian rhythm.

Avoid heavy and sweet snacks

Limit the intake of fatty, fried, and sweet foods in the evening, as they can disrupt sleep quality and cause discomfort.

Eating right before bedtime, especially at night, can negatively impact metabolism, increasing the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome through impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance.

Final comment:There are numerous observational studies and several randomized controlled trials that confirm the association between late meal consumption and negative metabolic effects, such as insulin resistance, weight gain, and a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. There is also a significant number of studies indicating that eating shortly before bedtime worsens sleep quality. Although the mechanisms are still being studied, available clinical and epidemiological data provide a solid basis for considering these relationships as well documented. However, the impact of small, nutritious snacks on muscle recovery is less confirmed and requires further research, which lowers the overall strength of evidence in this area.

Association of night eating habits with metabolic syndrome and its components: a longitudinal study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Both dinner before bed and snacks after dinner are associated with metabolic syndrome in women, but unrelated in men.

Abstract:Night time eating is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dinner immediately before bed, snacks after dinner, or combinations of both were associated with metabolic syndrome and its components in a large Japanese cohort. We enrolled 8153 adults aged 40–54 years who participated in specific medical checkups in an Okayama facility from 2009 to 2010 and from 2013 to 2014. Age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios of metabolic syndrome and its components in participants with both night eating habits for an average of 3.9 years were evaluated. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) was utilized to determine the supra-additive interaction of both eating habits on metabolic syndrome and its components. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for obesity for those with both eating habits compared to those with neither habit was 2.11 (95% confidence interval , 1.42–3.15) for men and 3.02 (95%CI, 1.72–5.29) for women. Both habits had a supra-additive interaction effect on obesity development in women (RERI, 1.67; RERI%, 85.0; p = 0.058), although this result was not significant. In women, there was an association between eating habits at night and metabolic syndrome, but in men it was unrelated. Both night eating habits were associated with dyslipidemia in men and women. These findings suggest the need for intervention and awareness among individuals with night eating habits to mitigate further complications.

The Health Impact of Nighttime Eating: Old and New Perspectives

Key takeaways:Nighttime consumption of small, nutrient-dense foods may be beneficial for muscle protein synthesis and cardiometabolic health, especially when combined with exercise.

Abstract:Nighttime eating, particularly before bed, has received considerable attention. Limiting and/or avoiding food before nighttime sleep has been proposed as both a weight loss strategy and approach to improve health and body composition. Indeed, negative outcomes have been demonstrated in response to large mixed meals in populations that consume a majority of their daily food intake during the night. However, data is beginning to mount to suggest that negative outcomes may not be consistent when the food choice is small, nutrient-dense, low energy foods and/or single macronutrients rather than large mixed-meals. From this perspective, it appears that a bedtime supply of nutrients can promote positive physiological changes in healthy populations. In addition, when nighttime feeding is combined with exercise training, any adverse effects appear to be eliminated in obese populations. Lastly, in Type I diabetics and those with glycogen storage disease, eating before bed is essential for survival. Nevertheless, nighttime consumption of small (~150 kcals) single nutrients or mixed-meals does not appear to be harmful and may be beneficial for muscle protein synthesis and cardiometabolic health. Future research is warranted to elucidate potential applications of nighttime feeding alone and in combination with exercise in various populations of health and disease.

Effect of Night Time Eating on Postprandial Triglyceride Metabolism in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Literature Review

Key takeaways:Night eating may negatively affect postprandial lipid metabolism, potentially increasing cardiovascular disease risk in shift workers.

Abstract:Eating at night time, as is frequent in shift workers, may contribute to increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk through a disruption in usual lipid metabolism, resulting in repeated and sustained hyperlipidemia at night. This systematic review aimed to investigate the impact of eating a meal at night compared with the same meal eaten during the day on postprandial lipemia. Six databases were searched: CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Informit, and SCOPUS. Eligible studies were original research cross-over design with a minimum fasting period of 5 h before testing preceded by a standardized control meal; measured postprandial triacylglycerol (TAG) for 5 h or greater; had meal time between 0700 h and 1600 h for day time and between 2000 h and 0400 h for night time; and had within-study test meals (food or drink) that were identical in macronutrient composition and energy. Two authors independently completed eligibility and quality assessment using the American Dietetic Association Quality Criteria Checklist for Primary Research. After removing duplicates, 4,423 articles were screened, yielding 5 studies for qualitative synthesis. All studies identified at least one parameter of the postprandial TAG response that was different as a result of meal time (e.g., the total concentration or the time course kinetics). Two studies reported a greater total TAG concentration (area under curve) at night compared with day, and 3 studies found no difference. Four studies reported that the kinetics of the postprandial time course of TAGs was different at night compared with during the day. Inconsistent reporting in the primary studies was a limitation of the review. Night eating may negatively affect postprandial lipemia and this review shows there is a need to rigorously test this using standardized methods and analysis with larger sample sizes. This is critical for informing strategies to lower CVD risk for shift workers.

Chronotype Differences in Body Composition, Dietary Intake and Eating Behavior Outcomes: A Scoping Systematic Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late evening chronotypes are more likely to be overweight/obese with poorer metabolic health, due to unhealthy eating behaviors and unfavorable dietary intakes.

Abstract:ABSTRACT The timing and nutritional composition of food intake are important zeitgebers for the biological clocks in humans. Thus, eating at an inappropriate time (e.g., during the night) may have a desynchronizing effect on the biological clocks and, in the long term, may result in adverse health outcomes (e.g., weight gain, obesity, and poor metabolic function). Being a very late or early chronotype not only determines preferred sleep and wake times but may also influence subsequent mealtimes, which may affect the circadian timing system. In recent years, an increased number of studies have examined the relation between chronotype and health outcomes, with a main focus on absolute food intake and metabolic markers and, to a lesser extent, on dietary intake distribution and eating behavior. Therefore, this review aimed to systematically determine whether chronotype indirectly affects eating behaviors, dietary intake (timing, choice, nutrients), and biomarkers leading to body composition outcomes in healthy adults. A systematic literature search on electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane library) was performed (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews number: CRD42020219754). Only studies that included healthy adults (aged >18 y), classified according to chronotype and body composition profiles, using outcomes of dietary intake, eating behavior, and/or biomarkers, were considered. Of 4404 articles, 24 met the inclusion criteria. The results revealed that late compared with early chronotypes were more likely to be overweight/obese with poorer metabolic health. Both MT and ET had similar energy and macronutrient intakes, consuming food during their preferred sleep–wake timing: later for ET than MT. Most of the energy and macronutrient intakes were distributed toward nighttime for ET and exacerbated by unhealthy eating behaviors and unfavorable dietary intakes. These findings from our systematic review give further insight why higher rates of overweight/obesity and unhealthier metabolic biomarkers are more likely to occur in ET.

Later circadian timing of food intake is associated with increased body fat.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eating later in the circadian evening or night, rather than clock hour, is associated with increased body fat, independent of traditional risk factors like food intake and activity level.

Abstract:Background: Weight gain and obesity have reached alarming levels. Eating at a later clock hour is a newly described risk factor for adverse metabolic health; yet, how eating at a later circadian time influences body composition is unknown. Using clock hour to document eating times may be misleading owing to individual differences in circadian timing relative to clock hour.Objective: This study examined the relations between the timing of food consumption relative to clock hour and endogenous circadian time, content of food intake, and body composition.Design: We enrolled 110 participants, aged 18-22 y, in a 30-d cross-sectional study to document sleep and circadian behaviors within their regular daily routines. We used a time-stamped-picture mobile phone application to record all food intake across 7 consecutive days during a participant's regular daily routines and assessed their body composition and timing of melatonin release during an in-laboratory assessment.Results: Nonlean individuals (high body fat) consumed most of their calories 1.1 h closer to melatonin onset, which heralds the beginning of the biological night, than did lean individuals (low body fat) (log-rank P = 0.009). In contrast, there were no differences between lean and nonlean individuals in the clock hour of food consumption (P = 0.72). Multiple regression analysis showed that the timing of food intake relative to melatonin onset was significantly associated with the percentage of body fat and body mass index (both P < 0.05) while controlling for sex, whereas no relations were found between the clock hour of food intake, caloric amount, meal macronutrient composition, activity or exercise level, or sleep duration and either of these body composition measures (all P > 0.72).Conclusions: These results provide evidence that the consumption of food during the circadian evening and/or night, independent of more traditional risk factors such as amount or content of food intake and activity level, plays an important role in body composition. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02846077.

Metabolic Effects of Late Dinner in Healthy Volunteers - A Randomized Crossover Clinical Trial.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late dinner consumption leads to nocturnal glucose intolerance and reduced fatty acid oxidation, potentially promoting obesity if repeated chronically.

Abstract:CONTEXT
Consuming calories later in the day is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that eating a late dinner alters substrate metabolism during sleep in a manner that promotes obesity.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the impact of late dinner on nocturnal metabolism in healthy volunteers.

DESIGN AND SETTING
This is a randomized crossover trial of late dinner (LD, 22:00) versus routine dinner (RD, 18:00), with a fixed sleep period (23:00-07:00) in a laboratory setting.

PARTICIPANTS
20 healthy volunteers (10 males, 10 females), aged 26.0 ± 0.6 years, BMI 23.2 ± 0.7 kg/m2, accustomed to a bedtime between 22:00-01:00.

INTERVENTIONS
An isocaloric macronutrient diet was administered on both visits. Dinner (35% daily kcal, 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat) with an oral lipid tracer ( palmitate, 15 mg/kg) was given at 18:00 on RD and 22:00 on LD.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Nocturnal and next-morning hourly plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFAs), cortisol, dietary fatty acid oxidation, and overnight polysomnography.

RESULTS
LD caused a 4-hour shift in the postprandial period, overlapping with the sleep phase. Independent of this shift, the postprandial period following LD was characterized by higher glucose, a triglyceride peak delay, and lower FFA and dietary fatty acid oxidation. LD did not affect sleep architecture, but increased plasma cortisol. These metabolic changes were most pronounced in habitual earlier sleepers determined by actigraphy monitoring.

CONCLUSION
LD induces nocturnal glucose intolerance, and reduces fatty acid oxidation and mobilization, particularly in earlier sleepers. These effects might promote obesity if they recur chronically.

Meal Timing and Sleeping Energy Metabolism

Number of 

Key takeaways:Time-restricted eating for extended durations can decrease energy intake and body weight, with early time-restricted eating having greater effects than midday time-restricted eating.

Abstract:There is a physiological link between sleep and eating. Insufficient sleep is a risk factor for overeating and excess body weight gain, and molecules such as orexin and insulin play a role in the control of sleep and energy intake. The effects of dietary timing on sleep and energy metabolism were examined in this review. First, we examined sleep energy metabolism and sleep quality under time-restricted eating, including skipping breakfast or dinner. Second, the mechanisms, benefits, and translational potential of the effects of time-restricted diets on sleep were discussed. Time-restricted eating under controlled conditions, in which daily caloric intake was kept constant, affected the time course of energy metabolism but did not affect total energy expenditure over 24 h. In free-living conditions, time-restricted eating for extended durations (4–16 weeks) decreased energy intake and body weight, and the effects of early time-restricted eating were greater than that of midday time-restricted eating. Although assessment of sleep by polysomnographic recording remains to be performed, no negative effects on the subjective quality of sleep have been observed.

Impact of insufficient sleep on dysregulated blood glucose control under standardised meal conditions

Number of 

Key takeaways:Poor sleep efficiency and later bedtime routines are associated with more pronounced postprandial glycemic responses to breakfast, making sleep a modifiable therapeutic target for optimal metabolic health.

Abstract:Sleep, diet and exercise are fundamental to metabolic homeostasis. In this secondary analysis of a repeated measures, nutritional intervention study, we tested whether an individual's sleep quality, duration and timing impact glycaemic response to a breakfast meal the following morning.Healthy adults' data (N = 953 ) were analysed from the PREDICT dietary intervention trial. Participants consumed isoenergetic standardised meals over 2 weeks in the clinic and at home. Actigraphy was used to assess sleep variables (duration, efficiency, timing) and continuous glucose monitors were used to measure glycaemic variation (>8000 meals).Sleep variables were significantly associated with postprandial glycaemic control (2 h incremental AUC), at both between- and within-person levels. Sleep period time interacted with meal type, with a smaller effect of poor sleep on postprandial blood glucose levels when high-carbohydrate (low fat/protein) (pinteraction = 0.02) and high-fat (pinteraction = 0.03) breakfasts were consumed compared with a reference 75 g OGTT. Within-person sleep period time had a similar interaction (high carbohydrate: pinteraction = 0.001, high fat: pinteraction = 0.02). Within- and between-person sleep efficiency were significantly associated with lower postprandial blood glucose levels irrespective of meal type (both p < 0.03). Later sleep midpoint (time deviation from midnight) was found to be significantly associated with higher postprandial glucose, in both between-person and within-person comparisons (p = 0.035 and p = 0.051, respectively).Poor sleep efficiency and later bedtime routines are associated with more pronounced postprandial glycaemic responses to breakfast the following morning. A person's deviation from their usual sleep pattern was also associated with poorer postprandial glycaemic control. These findings underscore sleep as a modifiable, non-pharmacological therapeutic target for the optimal regulation of human metabolic health. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03479866.

Chronotype and Cancer: Emerging Relation Between Chrononutrition and Oncology from Human Studies

Number of 

Key takeaways:Time-related eating, such as morning chronotype, early time-restricted eating, and prolonged nighttime fasting, may potentially lead to a reduced cancer risk through cell cycle regulation, metabolic pathways, inflammation, and gut microbiota fluctuations.

Abstract:Fasting–feeding timing is a crucial pattern implicated in the regulation of daily circadian rhythms. The interplay between sleep and meal timing underscores the importance of maintaining circadian alignment in order to avoid creating a metabolic environment conducive to carcinogenesis following the molecular and systemic disruption of metabolic performance and immune function. The chronicity of such a condition may support the initiation and progression of cancer through a variety of mechanisms, including increased oxidative stress, immune suppression, and the activation of proliferative signaling pathways. This review aims to summarize current evidence from human studies and provide an overview of the potential mechanisms underscoring the role of chrononutrition (including time-restricted eating) on cancer risk. Current evidence shows that the morning chronotype, suggesting an alignment between physiological circadian rhythms and eating timing, is associated with a lower risk of cancer. Also, early time-restricted eating and prolonged nighttime fasting were also associated with a lower risk of cancer. The current evidence suggests that the chronotype influences cancer risk through cell cycle regulation, the modulation of metabolic pathways and inflammation, and gut microbiota fluctuations. In conclusion, although there are no clear guidelines on this matter, emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that the role of time-related eating (i.e., time/calorie-restricted feeding and intermittent/periodic fasting) could potentially lead to a reduced risk of cancer.

A bedtime milk snack does not impact RMR, substrate utilisation and appetite the following morning in mildly overweight males.

Number of 

Key takeaways:A bedtime milk snack containing 10 or 30 g of protein does not significantly impact next morning metabolism and appetite in mildly overweight adults.

Abstract:Nighttime eating is often associated with a negative impact on weight management and cardiometabolic health. However, data from recent acute metabolic studies have implicated a benefit of ingesting a bedtime snack for weight management. The present study compared the impact of ingesting a milk snack containing either 10 (BS10) or 30 g (BS30) protein with a non-energetic placebo (BS0) 30 min before bedtime on next morning metabolism, appetite and energy intake in mildly overweight males (age: 24·3 (sem 0·8) years; BMI: 27·4 (sem 1·1) kg/m2). Next morning measurements of RMR, appetite and energy intake were measured using indirect calorimetry, visual analogue scales and an ad libitum breakfast, respectively. Bedtime milk ingestion did not alter next morning RMR (BS0: 7822 (sem 276) kJ/d, BS10: 7482 (sem 262) kJ/d, BS30: 7851 (sem 261) kJ/d, P=0·19) or substrate utilisation as measured by RER (P=0·64). Bedtime milk ingestion reduced hunger (P=0·01) and increased fullness (P=0·04) during the evening immediately after snack ingestion, but elicited no effect the next morning. Next morning breakfast (BS0: 2187 (sem 365) kJ, BS10: 2070 (sem 336) kJ, BS30: 2582 (sem 384) kJ, P=0·21) and 24 h post-trial (P=0·95) energy intake was similar between conditions. To conclude, in mildly overweight adults, compared with a non-energetic placebo, a bedtime milk snack containing 10 or 30 g of protein does not confer changes in next morning whole-body metabolism and appetite that may favour weight management.

PSUN111 Rationale and Design of the Dinner Time 2 Trial: A Randomized, Crossover Trial to Compare the Effects of Delayed Eating vs Delayed Sleeping on Overnight Metabolism in Healthy Volunteers

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late dinner may increase metabolic risks, while early dinner and routine sleep may improve weight control and metabolic health.

Abstract:Abstract Background Obesity and its associated metabolic complications are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent studies suggest that the timing of meals may be critically important for weight control and metabolic health. Consuming calories later in the day is associated with greater risks of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Interventional diet studies show more weight loss with early, rather than later, eating. Our team conducted a randomized, crossover study ('Dinner Time Study') that compared the metabolic effects of routine dinner (6pm) vs late dinner (10pm) with a fixed sleep period (11pm-7am) in young, healthy adults. We found that late dinner caused an 18% increase in post-prandial glucose and a 10% decrease in dietary fat oxidation. These metabolic consequences in the long term may lead to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse metabolic effects of late dinner are mediated by circadian misalignment (eating at the 'wrong' time relative to the body's central circadian clock) or mediated by sleep (eating too close to bedtime, coinciding with the fall in metabolic rate induced by sleep). To address this question, we aim to examine the metabolic effects of early dinner, late dinner, and late dinner followed by delayed sleep, in healthy adults. Methods Dinner Time 2 Study is a randomized crossover trial with 3 treatment arms with a 3-4-week washout period: (1) early dinner + routine sleep; (2) late dinner + routine sleep; (3) late dinner + late sleep. Dinner times and bedtimes will be customized to each participant's central circadian rhythm (assessed by dim light melatonin onset, DLMO). The primary objectives of this study are to (1) examine the metabolic effects of early dinner (DLMO-3h) vs late dinner (DLMO+1h) with a fixed routine bedtime (DLMO+2h); (2) examine the metabolic effects of routine bedtime (DLMO+2h) vs delayed bedtime (DLMO+6h) with a fixed late dinner time (DLMO+1h). We will examine 24-h profiles of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides, and dietary fat oxidation using serial blood sampling and an ingested stable isotope ( palmitate) tracer. We aim to recruit 20 healthy adults, age 18-30 years old, with a BMI 18-29.9 kg/m2. Participants who perform night shift work or have any sleep disorders or metabolic diseases including diabetes are ineligible. Each participant will have 4 overnight admissions to our Clinical Research Unit (1 DLMO visit and 3 metabolic visits). A total of 3 participants have successfully completed the protocol since recruitment started in 2021. Conclusion Dinner Time 2 will greatly advance our understanding of the interactions between meal timing, sleep timing, and metabolism, which could inform the design and implementation of future studies that leverage chronobiology to combat diabetes and obesity.

Key takeaways:Late dinner timing increases nocturnal glucose, insulin, and cortisol levels, while decreasing free fatty acids, potentially promoting obesity development.

Abstract:Introduction: Consuming calories later in the day is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that eating a late dinner alters metabolic function during sleep in a manner that promotes obesity. Methods: We compared metabolic effects of routine dinnertime (RD, 18:00) versus late dinnertime (LD, 22:00) with a fixed sleep period (23:00-07:00) on the daily metabolic profile of healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. An isocaloric diet was administered at 8:00, 13:00, 18:00, or 22:00. For RD, dinner (35% daily kcal) was given at 18:00 and a snack (10% kcal) was given at 22:00; for LD, these meals were reversed. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected at 1-hour intervals from 17:00 to 12:00 the next day on both visits. We assessed plasma triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFAs), glucose, insulin, cortisol, and sleep architecture. Participants ingested a lipid tracer, palmitate with dinner to measure fatty acid oxidation. Time series data was analyzed using mixed effects regression models. Results: To date, eight participants (5 male and 3 females) aged 26.4 ± 0.7 years old, with a BMI of 24.1 ± 1.2 kg/m 2 completed the study. During sleep, LD increased plasma glucose ( β =16.8 mg/dl, P <0.001), insulin ( β =15.4 μ U/ml, P <0.001), cortisol ( β =1.5 μ g/dl, P =0.017), and decreased plasma FFA ( β =-0.1 mmol/l, P <0.001). Morning glucose, insulin, cortisol and FFA levels were not significantly different between two visits. Morning TG were increased by RD ( β =17.4 mg/dl, P <0.001). The evening postprandial period following LD was characterized by higher glucose and lower FFA as compared to RD ( P <0.05). Fatty acid oxidation will be measured by serial enrichment of plasma 2 H 2 0 (pending). Dinner time did not affect sleep architecture. Conclusion: LD increases nocturnal glucose, insulin, cortisol, and decreases FFA. The inhibition of nocturnal lipolysis with LD may lower morning TG. Overall, LD leads to an anabolic state during sleep that might promote the development of obesity. the plasma during sleep restriction. species richness and alpha diversity - the Chao1, ACE, Simpson, and Shannon indices - were regressed on self-reported sleep duration, extreme daytime sleepiness and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and actigraphy-measured sleep duration and wake after sleep onset (WASO). We estimated associations between each of the sleep and diversity measures separately, adjusting for age and sex and then additionally adjusting for BMI, moderate-vigorous physical activity, and dietary fat and fiber. Results: Adjusting for gender and age, greater WASO was stat-istically significantly associated with lower richness and alpha diversity. These associations remained significant (Chao1) or bor-derline significant (ACE and Shannon) after further adjustment for BMI, physical activity, and dietary fiber and fat; e.g., 60 minutes greater WASO was associated with an approximate 26% (95% CI=1%-50%) population standard deviation reduction in micro-bial richness measured by Chao1. In fully-adjusted models, greater sleepiness was associated with lower richness and diversity on all indices (p=0.01-0.06). The ESS and sleep duration were not associated with microbiota richness or diversity. Conclusion: Better sleep quality and less sleepiness are significantly associated with greater species richness and diversity of the gut microbiota in a general population sample of adults. Wisconsin (vita-min-D derivative), and PS(O-40:2) (a plasmalogen). Conclusion: Using discovery metabolomics we identified 13 metabolites associated with reduced S I during insufficient sleep. Increases in monoglycosylceramides are known to decrease S I , supporting our current findings. Decreases in overall phosphatidylcholine levels can disrupt cell-membrane integrity and are linked with metabolic disease. Links between the other identified metabolites and S I are less clear. Yet, these metabolites are all linked with oxidative stress suggesting oxidative stress during insufficient sleep may link these metabolites with S I . Collectively, our findings suggest altered lipid metabolism during insufficient sleep may contribute to reduced S I . Further lipidomics studies are required to validate our current discovery based metabolomics findings.

Time of day difference in postprandial glucose and insulin responses: Systematic review and meta-analysis of acute postprandial studies

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eating during the night leads to poorer glucose tolerance compared to eating during the day, potentially contributing to the increased risk of metabolic diseases in individuals who habitually eat during the night.

Abstract:ABSTRACT Current dietary trends show that humans consume up to 40% of their energy intake during the night. Those who habitually eat during the night are observed to have an increased risk of metabolic conditions such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence suggest that a biological consequence of eating during the night is a larger postprandial glucose response, compared to meals eaten earlier in the day. However, findings from individual acute postprandial studies have been inconsistent, due to variations in protocols. Therefore, this review aimed to systematically summarize findings from acute postprandial studies and investigate whether postprandial glucose and insulin response at night differs to during the day in healthy adults. This would indicate a possible physiological mechanism linking habitual nighttime eating and increased risk of metabolic conditions. Seven electronic databases were searched in February 2018. Included studies met the following criteria: had a day-time test between 0700 – 1600h, a nighttime test between 2000 and 0400h, the test meals were identical and consumed by the same participant at both day and night time points, preceded by a 3-h fast (minimum). Primary outcome measures were postprandial glucose and insulin incremental area under the curve (iAUC) or area under the curve (AUC). Studies that reported numerical data were included in the meta-analyses, conducted using Stata statistical software (version 13.0, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). For eligible studies that did not report numerical data, their authors’ conclusions on the effect of time of day on the primary outcome measures were summarized qualitatively. Full text of 172 articles were assessed for eligibility. Fifteen studies met the eligibility criteria, ten of which were included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analysis for glucose showed a lower postprandial glucose response in the day compared to during the night, after an identical meal (SMD = −1.66; 95% CI, −1.97 to −1.36; p < .001). This was supported by the findings from included studies ineligible for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis also showed a lower postprandial insulin response in the day compared to during the night (SMD = −0.35; 95% CI, −0.63 to −0.06; p = .016). However, findings from included studies ineligible for meta-analysis were inconsistent. Our results suggest poor glucose tolerance at night compared to the day. This may be a contributing factor to the increased risk of metabolic diseases observed in those who habitually eat during the night, such as shift workers.

Timing of food intake during simulated night shift impacts glucose metabolism: A controlled study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eating at night may increase the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in shift workers, while not eating at night may limit metabolic consequences.

Abstract:ABSTRACT Eating during the night may increase the risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes in shift workers. This study examined the impact of either eating or not eating a meal at night on glucose metabolism. Participants underwent four nights of simulated night work (SW1–4, 16:00–10:00 h, <50 lux) with a daytime sleep opportunity each day (10:00–16:00 h, <3 lux). Healthy males were assigned to an eating at night (NE; n = 4, meals; 07:00, 19:00 and 01:30 h) or not eating at night (NEN; n = 7, meals; 07:00 h, 09:30, 16:10 and 19:00 h) condition. Meal tolerance tests were conducted post breakfast on pre-night shift (PRE), SW4 and following return to day shift (RTDS), and glucose and insulin area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. Mixed-effects ANOVAs were used with fixed effects of condition and day, and their interactions, and a random effect of subject identifier on the intercept. Fasting glucose and insulin were not altered by day or condition. There were significant effects of day and condition × day (both p < 0.001) for glucose AUC, with increased glucose AUC observed solely in the NE condition from PRE to SW4 (p = 0.05) and PRE to RTDS (p < 0.001). There was also a significant effect of day (p = 0.007) but not condition × day (p = 0.825) for insulin AUC, with increased insulin from PRE to RTDS in both eating at night (p = 0.040) and not eating at night (p = 0.006) conditions. Results in this small, healthy sample suggest that not eating at night may limit the metabolic consequences of simulated night work. Further study is needed to explore whether matching food intake to the biological clock could reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes in shift workers.

Timing Matters: The Interplay between Early Mealtime, Circadian Rhythms, Gene Expression, Circadian Hormones, and Metabolism—A Narrative Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Aligning mealtime with the body's natural circadian rhythms promotes metabolic health and prevents metabolic disorders, while later meal consumption is associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic disorders.

Abstract:Achieving synchronization between the central and peripheral body clocks is essential for ensuring optimal metabolic function. Meal timing is an emerging field of research that investigates the influence of eating patterns on our circadian rhythm, metabolism, and overall health. This narrative review examines the relationship between meal timing, circadian rhythm, clock genes, circadian hormones, and metabolic function. It analyzes the existing literature and experimental data to explore the connection between mealtime, circadian rhythms, and metabolic processes. The available evidence highlights the importance of aligning mealtime with the body’s natural rhythms to promote metabolic health and prevent metabolic disorders. Specifically, studies show that consuming meals later in the day is associated with an elevated prevalence of metabolic disorders, while early time-restricted eating, such as having an early breakfast and an earlier dinner, improves levels of glucose in the blood and substrate oxidation. Circadian hormones, including cortisol and melatonin, interact with mealtimes and play vital roles in regulating metabolic processes. Cortisol, aligned with dawn in diurnal mammals, activates energy reserves, stimulates appetite, influences clock gene expression, and synchronizes peripheral clocks. Consuming meals during periods of elevated melatonin levels, specifically during the circadian night, has been correlated with potential implications for glucose tolerance. Understanding the mechanisms of central and peripheral clock synchronization, including genetics, interactions with chronotype, sleep duration, and hormonal changes, provides valuable insights for optimizing dietary strategies and timing. This knowledge contributes to improved overall health and well-being by aligning mealtime with the body’s natural circadian rhythm.

Effects of Dinner Timing on Sleep Stage Distribution and EEG Power Spectrum in Healthy Volunteers

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late dinner (1 hour before sleep) in healthy volunteers did not cause significant adverse changes in sleep architecture, and was associated with deeper sleep initially and lighter sleep later in the night.

Abstract:Purpose Eating time and sleep habits are important modifiable behaviors that affect metabolic health, but the relationship between food intake and sleep remains incompletely understood. Observational data suggest that late food intake is associated with impaired sleep quality. We examined the effect of routine dinner (RD, 5 hours before bedtime) vs late dinner (LD, 1 hour before bedtime) on sleep architecture in healthy volunteers. Participants and Methods This was a post hoc analysis of a randomized crossover study of RD vs LD with a fixed sleep opportunity in a laboratory setting. On each of the two visits, 20 healthy adult volunteers (10 women) received an isocaloric meal followed by overnight polysomnography. Sleep architecture over the course of the night was assessed using visual sleep staging and EEG spectral power analysis and was compared between RD and LD. We modeled the proportions of spectral power in alpha, beta, delta, and theta bands as functions of dinner timing, time of night, and their interaction with mixed-effect spline regression. Results Conventional sleep stages were similar between the 2 visits. LD caused a 2.5% initial increase in delta power and a reciprocal 2.7% decrease in combined alpha and beta power (p<0.0001). These effects diminished as sleep continued with a reversal of these patterns in the latter part of the night. Conclusion Contrary to the existing literature, shifting dinner timing from 5 hours before sleep to 1 hour before sleep in healthy volunteers did not result in significant adverse changes in overnight sleep architecture. In fact, LD was associated with deeper sleep in the beginning of the night and lighter sleep in the latter part of the night in healthy volunteers. This novel manifestation of postprandial hypersomnia may have therapeutic potential in patients with sleep disorders.

Timing of Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Effects on Obesity and Metabolic Risk

Number of 

Key takeaways:Unusual eating times can disrupt the circadian system, potentially leading to unhealthy consequences like obesity and metabolic risk.

Abstract:(1) Background: Eating is fundamental to survival. Animals choose when to eat depending on food availability. The timing of eating can synchronize different organs and tissues that are related to food digestion, absorption, or metabolism, such as the stomach, gut, liver, pancreas, or adipose tissue. Studies performed in experimental animal models suggest that food intake is a major external synchronizer of peripheral clocks. Therefore, the timing of eating may be decisive in fat accumulation and mobilization and affect the effectiveness of weight loss treatments. (2) Results: We will review multiple studies about the timing of the three main meals of the day, breakfast, lunch and dinner, and its potential impact on metabolism, glucose tolerance, and obesity-related factors. We will also delve into several mechanisms that may be implicated in the obesogenic effect of eating late. Conclusion: Unusual eating time can produce a disruption in the circadian system that might lead to unhealthy consequences.

Associations between bedtime eating or drinking, sleep duration and wake after sleep onset: findings from the American time use survey

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eating or drinking less than 1 hour before bedtime is associated with longer sleep duration but increased wake after sleep onset (WASO).

Abstract:Abstract Sleep hygiene recommendations discourage eating before bedtime; however, the impact of mealtime on sleep has been inconsistent. We examined gender-stratified associations between eating or drinking <1, <2 and <3 h before bedtime, sleep duration and wake after sleep onset (WASO >30 min). This study utilised 2003–2018 data from the American Time Use Survey, a nationally representative sample of USA residents aged ≥15 years. Participants recorded weekday/weekend activities during a 24-h period. Age-specific sleep duration and WASO were estimated categorically and continuously. Eating or drinking were identified from all activities recorded <1, <2 and <3 h before bedtime. Mean ± se sleep duration was 8·0 ± 0·006 h, and 6% of participants ate or drank <1 h prior to weekdays bedtime. Overall, eating or drinking <1 h prior to bedtime was associated with longer weekdays sleep duration. Women and men who ate or drank <1 h before bedtime, v. those who did not, had 35 min (95% CI (30,39)) and 25 min (95 % CI (21,29)) longer sleep duration, respectively, as well as increased odds of WASO; women (OR=2·03, 95% CI (1·66,2·49)) and men (OR=2·64, 95% CI (2·08,3·36)). As the interval of eating or drinking prior to bedtime expanded, odds of short and long sleep durations and WASO decreased. This population-based data linked eating or drinking <1 h before bedtime to longer sleep duration, but increased WASO. Eating or drinking further from bedtime lowers the odds of short and long sleep duration and WASO. Causal pathways are difficult to discern, though inefficient sleep after late-night eating could increase WASO and trigger compensatory increases in sleep duration.

0158 Nighttime Snacking and Sleep: Comparing Commercially-Available Snacks Consumed Before Bed

Number of 

Key takeaways:NightFood ice cream may improve sleep quality and energy the next morning, while Ben & Jerry's ice cream may worsen sleep quality and energy.

Abstract:Most Americans snack at night, though caloric consumption and consumption of certain nutrients and ingredients at night can contribute to sleep disruption and cardiometabolic disease risk. Chips, cookies, ice cream and candy are the most popular snacks consumed before bed. Perhaps certain snacks at night can minimize risks to sleep and cardiometabolic health due to nutritional profile, ingredient composition, and other factors.
 
 
 
 Seventy-seven adults completed a 5-week open-label crossover study. They consumed the same snack each night for 3 days, then had a 4-day washout before switching to the next product. Product order was randomized and included NightFood ice cream (NF; product of interest), Halo Top ice cream (HT; “healthy” comparator), Ben & Jerry’s ice cream (B&J; “indulgent” comparator), Lay’s potato chips (LAYS; non-ice cream comparator), and no snack. Participants completed daily ratings (3-day mean) for daytime energy, evening cravings, nighttime relaxation, feelings of satisfaction, bloating/discomfort, difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, feeling refreshed, and sleep continuity (sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, awakenings). Linear mixed models were adjusted for order.
 
 
 
 B&J was associated with lower daytime energy vs no snack. B&J and NF were associated with more relaxation at night vs LAYS. All three ice-creams were more satisfying vs LAYS post-snack, but NF and B&J were much more satisfying than HT, and not different from each other. HT and NF were rated lower on bloating/discomfort than LAYS, while B&J was rated much higher. Individuals went to bed earlier if they ate LAYS (~40 minutes), or NF (~25 minutes) vs no snack. Compared to no snack, individuals who ate NF were less likely to report difficulty initiating sleep or returning to sleep, greater sleep quality, and greater feelings of rest and energy the next morning. Conversely, individuals who ate B&J had worse sleep quality and energy the next morning.
 
 
 
 Snacks formulated to satisfy cravings while minimizing sleep disruption and including ingredients that may support sleep may be a preferable option for individuals who choose to snack at night. Future work is needed to better understand how to minimize risks and potential adverse impacts of nighttime snacking.

Does the Proximity of Meals to Bedtime Influence the Sleep of Young Adults? A Cross-Sectional Survey of University Students

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eating within 3 hours of bedtime is associated with increased nocturnal awakenings in young adults, suggesting meal timing may be a modifiable risk factor for disrupted sleep.

Abstract:Avoiding food before bedtime is a widely accepted sleep hygiene practice, yet few studies have assessed meal timing as a risk factor for disrupted sleep. This study examined the relationship between evening meal timing and sleep quality in young adults. A total of N = 793 participants (26% male) aged between 18 and 29 years responded to an online survey, which captured sociodemographic information, lifestyle variables, and sleep characteristics. Meal timing was defined as meals more than 3 h before or within 3 h of bedtime. The outcomes were as follows: one or more nocturnal awakenings, sleep onset latency of >30 min, and sleep duration of ≤6 h. Logistic regression analyses showed that eating within 3 h of bedtime was positively associated with nocturnal awakening (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.15–2.27) but not long sleep onset latency (1.24; 0.89–1.73) or short sleep duration (0.79; 0.49–1.26). The relationship remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders of ethnicity and body mass index (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.00–2.04). Meal timing appears to be a modifiable risk factor for nocturnal awakenings and disrupted sleep. However, this is a preliminary cross-sectional study and highlights the need for additional research on the influence of the timing of food intake on sleep.

Association of Evening Eating with Sleep Quality and Insomnia among Adults in a Brazilian National Survey

Number of 

Key takeaways:An early-eating schedule has beneficial sleep effects, with a shorter sleep latency when eating 20:00 and 7-8 hours before sleep, and avoiding caffeine and sugary foods after 18:00.

Abstract:Abstract Objective  To examine the association of evening eating clock time, its elapsed time to the midpoint of sleep (TEM), consumption of caffeine and sugary foods, and reporting dinner as the largest meal with sleep quality indicators and insomnia. Methods  Participants ( n  = 2,050;18–65y) were part of population-based research, with virtual data collection. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess differences in the ORs(95%CI) of sleep duration < 7 hours, sleep latency > 30 minutes, poor sleep quality, and insomnia (outcomes) with the evening diet-related variables. Linear regression analyses evaluated differences in sleep duration and latency associated with the same variables. Restricted cubic splines were used to study the shape of the association of eating event clock time and TEM with sleep duration and latency. Results  Each additional hour of evening eating clock time and of the TEM, respectively increased and decreased, the odds of sleep duration < 7/h , sleep latency > 30min , poor sleep quality and insomnia . We found a dose-response association between evening eating (clock time and TEM) and sleep duration. The shortest latency was seen when evening eating was ∼20:00 and ∼7–8 hours before the midpoint of sleep. Participants who reported dinner as the largest meal and consumed caffeine and sugary foods/beverages after 18:00 presented higher odds of sleep duration < 7 hours, poor quality, and insomnia. Conclusions  Our findings indicate that an early-eating schedule has beneficial sleep effects and that it will be necessary to consider evening eating patterns and timing, along with the existing sleep and circadian hygiene, to improve sleep quality and circadian health.

Does eating a fourth meal (siu-yeh) before bedtime affect sleep quality and dream experiences?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Night eating is positively related to dream intensity, but satiety before bedtime does not affect dream intensity.

Abstract:This study examined the relationship between night eating, sleep quality, and dream experiences. A total of 215 Hong Kong participants completed the Night Eating Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Dream Intensity Scale and answered some questions about their frequency of food intake between dinner and bedtime, food choice for night eating, and beliefs regarding the effects of night eating and satiety on dreams. The overall results indicate that night eating as a pathological propensity or normal habit is positively related to the phenomenological experience of dream intensity and this relationship is moderated but cannot be fully explained by sleep quality or the beliefs about the effects of night eating and satiety on dreams. Additionally, night eating is extremely common in Hong Kong and is related to poor sleep quality. However, the feeling of satiety before bedtime does not appear to modulate subjective dream intensity.

Eating habits are associated with subjective sleep quality outcomes among university students: findings of a cross-sectional study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Healthy eating habits, such as skipping breakfast and replacing meals with snacks, may improve sleep quality and sleep components among university students.

Abstract:PurposeThis study investigated the relationships between eating habits and sleep quality among university students.MethodsIn a cross-sectional study, university students completed a self-report questionnaire to assess eating habits and meal timing. We assessed subjective sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and examined the associations between eating habits and overall sleep quality and its components.ResultsFour hundred ninety-eight students participated in the study. Students who used to skip breakfast, ate late-night snacks, and replaced meals with snacks were at 1.20 times, 1.24 times, and 1.25 times higher likelihood of having poor overall sleep quality, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that skipping breakfast (r =  − 0.111, P = 0.007), late-night snacks (r =  − 0.109, P = 0.007), replacing meals with snacks (r =  − 0.126, P = 0.002), and irregular mealtimes (r =  − 0.094, P = 0.018) were the best correlates with poor sleep quality. After adjustment to demographic variables, replacing meals with snacks followed by skipping breakfast were the best independent associations with poor sleep quality by the PSQI.ConclusionsEating habits and meal timing were significantly associated with sleep quality. We speculate that healthy eating habits may lead to improved sleep quality and sleep components among university students.

Effects of Diet on Sleep Quality.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Dietary patterns and specific foods, such as milk, fatty fish, tart cherry juice, and kiwifruit, may promote high-quality sleep.

Abstract:There is much emerging information surrounding the impact of sleep duration and quality on food choice and consumption in both children and adults. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of dietary patterns and specific foods on nighttime sleep. Early studies have shown that certain dietary patterns may affect not only daytime alertness but also nighttime sleep. In this review, we surveyed the literature to describe the role of food consumption on sleep. Research has focused on the effects of mixed meal patterns, such as high-carbohydrate plus low-fat or low-carbohydrate diets, over the short term on sleep. Such studies highlight a potential effect of macronutrient intakes on sleep variables, particularly alterations in slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep with changes in carbohydrate and fat intakes. Other studies instead examined the intake of specific foods, consumed at a fixed time relative to sleep, on sleep architecture and quality. Those foods, specifically milk, fatty fish, tart cherry juice, and kiwifruit, are reviewed here. Studies provide some evidence for a role of certain dietary patterns and foods in the promotion of high-quality sleep, but more studies are necessary to confirm those preliminary findings.

Effect of Time-Restricted Eating on Sleep Quality and Body Composition: A Systematic Review.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Time-restricted eating effectively reduces weight and fat mass, but most studies found no significant effect on sleep parameters.

Abstract:CONTEXT
Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary approach that consolidates energy intake in a restricted period during the day. It is an alternative approach to weight loss and might be important to sleep quality.

OBJECTIVE
To review the current literature related to the effects of TRE on sleep quality and body composition in adults.

DATA SOURCES
A literature search of the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (Clarivate), and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde/Bireme databases was carried out until May 2024.

DATA EXTRACTION
Reviewed articles included clinical, interventional (controlled or uncontrolled) studies including individuals older than 18 years, with no gender restriction. The interventions had to control feeding time, body composition could be assessed by any validated method, and sleep could be assessed by polysomnography, actigraphy, and validated sleep assessment questionnaires.

DATA ANALYSIS
Eleven studies were included in this systematic review. Study samples varied between 19 and 137 participants, with a predominance of female participants in 10 studies. Seven of the studies (58.3%) tested an intervention of 8 hours of TRE, with an intervention range of between 4 weeks and 12 months. All studies observed weight loss. Nine studies showed reductions in fat mass, including 2 studies that observed reductions in visceral fat mass. No studies, independently of weight loss or body composition changes, objectively observed changes in sleep duration after TRE interventions. However, in the subjective evaluation, 1 study found a reduction in sleep duration of 30 ± 13 minutes, an increase in latency of 7 ± 3 minutes, and a reduction in sleep efficiency of 2% ± 1% in the group treated with TRE compared with the control group.

CONCLUSION
Time-restricted eating seems to be effective in weight loss and fat mass reduction, but most studies found no effect on sleep parameters. There was a lack of standardized methods for sleep measurements in the reviewed studies. However, these results could provide valuable data for the design and formulation of new well-founded studies assessing sleep using objective methods and including different sleep parameters.

An Overview of the Relationship Between Meal Timing and Sleep

Number of 

Key takeaways:Meal timing and dietary content may impact sleep quality, with some studies suggesting that eating close to bedtime may enhance certain sleep parameters.

Abstract:Sleep is a crucial aspect of maintaining overall health, yet its mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Sleep deprivation has been linked to numerous social, mental, and physical issues, prompting investigations into various treatment methods. Among these, dietary factors such as meal content and timing have garnered attention. While much of the literature suggests that eating close to bedtime disrupts sleep quality, recent findings propose that considering dietary content may yield different outcomes, potentially enhancing certain sleep parameters. This study seeks to examine the association between meal timing and sleep parameters, aiming to shed light on this complex relationship.

Sleep Quality: A Narrative Review on Nutrition, Stimulants, and Physical Activity as Important Factors

Number of 

Key takeaways:Nutrition, stimulants, and physical activity significantly affect sleep quality, with sleep hygiene also playing a role.

Abstract:Sleep is a cyclically occurring, transient, and functional state that is controlled primarily by neurobiological processes. Sleep disorders and insomnia are increasingly being diagnosed at all ages. These are risk factors for depression, mental disorders, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and/or high blood pressure. A number of factors can negatively affect sleep quality, including the use of stimulants, stress, anxiety, and the use of electronic devices before sleep. A growing body of evidence suggests that nutrition, physical activity, and sleep hygiene can significantly affect the quality of sleep. The aim of this review was to discuss the factors that can affect sleep quality, such as nutrition, stimulants, and physical activity.

Breakfast Consumption Augments Appetite, Eating Behavior, and Exploratory Markers of Sleep Quality Compared with Skipping Breakfast in Healthy Young Adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Breakfast consumption improves appetite, satiety, and diet quality, and may support some aspects of sleep health in healthy young adults.

Abstract:Abstract Background Observational studies show associations between breakfast skipping, reduced satiety, and poor sleep quality; however, intervention studies are lacking. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of consuming breakfast compared with breakfast skipping on appetitive, hormonal, and neural markers of appetite and satiety; ad libitum food intake; and exploratory measures of sleep health in young adults. Methods Thirteen adults completed the following randomized crossover-design study. Participants consumed a high-protein breakfast (“Breakfast”; 340 kcal, 30 g protein, 36 g carbohydrate, 9 g fat) or skipped breakfast (“Skip”) for 7 d/treatment. On day 7, an 8-h clinical testing day was completed including assessments of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective food consumption (PFC), related hormones, food cue–stimulated functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, and ad libitum evening food intake. Sleep quantity and quality were assessed with 7-d actigraphy, 7-d sleep diaries, and sleep-related hormones. Results Morning and daily hunger, desire to eat, PFC, and ghrelin decreased, whereas fullness increased after the Breakfast pattern compared with after the Skip pattern (all, P < 0.05). No difference in peptide YY (PYY) concentrations were detected. Hippocampal, parahippocampal, and middle frontal gyrus activations were reduced after the Breakfast pattern compared with the Skip pattern (all, P < 0.01). Although no differences in daily food intake were observed, the Breakfast pattern reduced evening intake of high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods (P < 0.05), whereas evening sugar intake tended to be reduced compared with the Skip pattern (P = 0.085). Although Breakfast led to shorter total sleep time (TST) compared with Skip (P < 0.05), no difference in sleep efficiency (TST/sleep period) was detected. Perceived sleep quality and sleep onset tended to improve after Breakfast compared with after Skip (P = 0.060 and P = 0.07, respectively). Conclusion Breakfast consumption improved appetite, satiety, and diet quality and may support some aspects of sleep health in healthy young adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03031132.

Eating Your Feelings? Testing a Model of Employees’ Work-Related Stressors, Sleep Quality, and Unhealthy Eating

Number of 

Key takeaways:Work-related stressors in the morning increase unhealthy eating habits, but poor sleep quality buffers this effect, reducing negative mood in the evening.

Abstract:Although organizational research on health-related behaviors has become increasingly popular, little attention has been paid to unhealthy eating. Drawing on the self-regulation perspective, we conducted 2 daily diary studies to examine the relationships between work-related stressors, sleep quality, negative mood, and eating behaviors. Study 1 sampled 125 participants from 5 Chinese information technology companies and showed that when participants experienced higher levels of job demands in the morning, they consumed more types of unhealthy food and fewer types of healthy food in the evening. In addition, sleep quality from the previous night buffered the effect of morning job demands on evening unhealthy food consumption. Study 2 used data from 110 customer service employees from a Chinese telecommunications company and further demonstrated a positive association between morning customer mistreatment and evening overeating behaviors, as well as the buffering effect of sleep quality. Results from Study 2 also supported afternoon negative mood as a mediator linking morning customer mistreatment to evening overeating behaviors. Finally, our findings revealed that the buffering effect of sleep quality was channeled through employees’ vigor in the morning, which subsequently weakened the effect of customer mistreatment on negative mood.

The Association between Diet and Sleep Quality among Spanish University Students

Number of 

Key takeaways:Unhealthy eating habits and a lack of balanced intake of vegetables, fruits, dairy, lean meats, legumes, sweets, and sugary soft drinks are associated with poor sleep quality among Spanish university students.

Abstract:While it has long been recognized that diet is a leading behavioral risk factor for human health, recent scientific findings have also suggested that diet and sleep quality may be connected. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the association between diet and sleep quality among a group of Spanish university students. To do so, a cross-sectional study of 868 students was carried out. Sleep quality was assessed using the Spanish version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while diet was assessed using the Spanish Healthy Eating Index (SHEI). The study revealed a noteworthy rate of bad sleepers (51.6%) and students whose diet needed modifications (82.2%). Unhealthy eaters were more likely to have poor sleep quality (aOR = 4.20; CI 95%: 2.07–8.52). The unbalanced intake of vegetables (aOR = 1.63; CI 95%: 1.14–2.34), fruits (aOR = 4.08; CI 95%: 2.90–5.74), dairy products (aOR = 1.96; CI 95%: 1.41–2.72), lean meats (aOR = 1.82; CI 95%: 1.19–2.78), legumes (aOR = 1.43; CI 95%: 1.00–2.02), sweets (aOR = 1.60; CI 95%: 1.13–2.25) and sugary soft drinks (aOR = 1.46; CI 95%: 1.07–1.99) was associated with lower sleep quality.

Cardiorenal Metabolic Consequences of Nighttime Snacking: Is it an Innocent Eating Behavior?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Nighttime eating is linked to various metabolic and cardiorenal outcomes, with potential causes including disrupted circadian rhythm, altered hormonal levels, and decline in cellular regeneration.

Abstract:Purpose of ReviewHealth consequences of nighttime eating, as a publicly discussed eating behavior type, have been speculated lately. Nighttime eating has been linked to various metabolic outcomes including hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, weight gain, elevated blood pressure, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and cardiorenal outcomes such as atherosclerosis, a decline in eGFR, and proteinuria.Recent FindingsAlthough the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism is not yet clear, multiple hypotheses including disrupted circadian rhythm, altered hormonal levels, and decline in cellular regeneration have been proposed.SummaryIn this review, we aim to evaluate the growing literature on nighttime eating behavior in terms of metabolic and cardiorenal outcomes, pathophysiological basis, and potential therapeutic alternatives.

Disordered eating and obesity: associations between binge‐eating disorder, night‐eating syndrome, and weight‐related comorbidities

Number of 

Key takeaways:Binge-eating disorder and night-eating syndrome are associated with weight gain, metabolic dysfunction, and higher risk of psychopathology.

Abstract:Binge‐eating disorder (BED) and night‐eating syndrome (NES) are two forms of disordered eating associated with overweight and obesity. While these disorders also occur in nonobese persons, they seem to be associated with weight gain over time and higher risk of diabetes and other metabolic dysfunction. BED and NES are also associated with higher risk of psychopathology, including mood, anxiety, and sleep problems, than those of similar weight status without disordered eating. Treatments are available, including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy, lisdexamfetamine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for BED; and CBT, SSRIs, progressive muscle relaxation, and bright light therapy for NES.

Emotion Regulation in Binge Eating Disorder: A Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Negative emotions and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies contribute to the onset and maintenance of binge eating in individuals with Binge Eating Disorder.

Abstract:The purpose of the present review is to provide a summary of the research findings on emotion regulation in Binge Eating Disorder (BED). Negative emotions and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies play a role in the onset and maintenance of binge eating in BED. Anger and sadness, along with negative emotions related to interpersonal experiences (i.e., disappointment, being hurt or loneliness), seem to be particularly relevant. Individuals with BED have a tendency to suppress and ruminate on their unwanted emotions, which leads to increased psychopathological thoughts and symptoms. Compared to healthy controls, they use adaptive strategies, such as reappraisal, less frequently. Evidence concerning the causal relation between negative affect and binge eating is inconclusive and still very limited. While experimental studies in a laboratory setting lack ecological validity, ecological momentary assessment studies offer more promise at unraveling the causal relationship between emotions and binge eating. Increases in negative affect are found to be antecedents of binge eating in BED. However, there seems to be less support for the possibility that binge eating serves as a means to alleviate negative affect. Finally, BED seems to be related to other forms of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as substance abuse and self-harm.

Key takeaways:Binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome are common in adults with type 2 diabetes, and BED is associated with higher BMI, but their impact on diabetes management and long-term outcomes remains unclear.

Abstract:Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing in prevalence worldwide, and is closely linked to obesity. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are eating disorders that are common in obesity, and may affect the management as well as long term outcomes of T2DM. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the prevalence and associations of BED or NES in adults with T2DM.We conducted a systematic review. The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and AMED were searched for articles which met the inclusion criteria; including patients > 18 years old, with T2DM, and BED and/or NES. The reference lists of included studies were also searched. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies that measured the outcomes of interest.A total of 10 studies (2 included NES) were included in this systematic review. The number screened for BED and NES were 6527 and 1039 participants, respectively. Point prevalence was 1.2-8.0% for BED and 3.8-8.4% for NES. Patients with T2DM and BED had higher BMI than patients with T2DM without BED in the two studies that reported BMI. There was no statistically significant difference in HbA1c between patients with and without BED in the two studies that measured HbA1c.BED and NES are common in adults with T2DM, and BED is associated with higher BMI in patients with T2DM. However, only two studies reported important outcomes measures such as BMI and HbA1c in patients with T2DM. Hence, further well-designed studies are needed to assess the impact of BED and NES in patients with T2DM. Health Care Professionals should consider the diagnosis of BED and NES in patients with T2DM.

The role of affect in the maintenance of binge-eating disorder: Evidence from an ecological momentary assessment study.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Binge-eating episodes in individuals with binge-eating disorder improve positive affect and decrease negative affect, suggesting that binge eating may function to alleviate unpleasant emotional experiences.

Abstract:Affect regulation models of eating disorder behavior, which predict worsening of affect prior to binge-eating episodes and improvement in affect following such episodes, have received support in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. However, limited work has examined the trajectories of affect surrounding binge eating in binge-eating disorder (BED). In the current study, ecological momentary assessment data from 112 men and women with BED were used to examine the trajectories of positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), guilt, fear, hostility, and sadness relative to binge-eating episodes. Prior to binge episodes, PA significantly decreased, whereas NA and guilt significantly increased. Following binge episodes, levels of NA and guilt significantly decreased and PA stabilized. Overall, results indicate improvements in affect following binge-eating episodes, suggesting that binge eating may function to alleviate unpleasant emotional experiences among individuals with BED, which is consistent with affect regulation models of eating pathology. Because improvements in negative affect were primarily driven by change in guilt, findings also highlight the relative importance of understanding the relationship between guilt and binge-eating behavior within this population.

Preoperative Binge Eating and Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Pre-bariatric binge eating disorder (BED) has little or no influence on weight loss after bariatric surgery.

Abstract:BackgroundSeveral studies have investigated if bariatric surgery candidates with binge eating disorder (BED) are at risk for suboptimal postoperative weight loss. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between binge eating diagnosed preoperatively and weight loss after bariatric surgery.MethodsMEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS, and other specialized databases were searched on August 2020. Clinical trials and observational studies including individuals who had undergone any type of bariatric surgical treatment with preoperative evaluation of BED and at least one postoperative measure of weight were initially selected. Four reviewers independently screened for eligibility. The mean difference was calculated using the random-effects model.ResultsNineteen studies, comprising 3223 participants (80.25% women; median age 41 years), met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. At 6 months postoperative, the percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was not significantly different between BED and non-BED groups , even when analyzing only those three studies that included gold standard assessment tools. No significant differences were found at 12, 24, 36, or 60 months.ConclusionsPre-bariatric BED seems to have little or no influence on weight loss after surgery. However, many questions remain unanswered because of the use of different measures across studies. The heterogeneity among studies emphasizes the importance of investigators using the same assessment measures.

Medical comorbidity and medical complications associated with binge-eating disorder.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Binge-eating disorder (BED) may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome components in adults and children, with limited evidence suggesting other organ systems may be affected.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of possible medical complications of binge-eating disorder (BED).

METHOD
Literature on BED, both in obese and nonobese patients, was reviewed.

RESULTS
A growing literature suggests that BED independently may increase the likelihood of developing components of the metabolic syndrome, and that LOC eating in children may contribute to weight gain and metabolic disturbances. Limited evidence suggests that other organ systems may be affected by BED as well.

DISCUSSION
Additional prospective studies are needed. Although the results of the available studies are not definitive and provide somewhat mixed results, there does appear to be a clear suggestion of an increased risk for the development of components of the metabolic syndrome in adults and children.

Eating behavior and eating disorders in adults before bariatric surgery.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Before bariatric surgery, 15.7% of patients had binge eating disorder, with factors like college education, eating more, medication use, alcohol use, lower self-esteem, and depressive symptoms increasing the odds.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
To describe eating patterns, prevalence of problematic eating behaviors, and determine factors associated with binge eating disorder (BED), before bariatric surgery.

METHOD
Before surgery, 2,266 participants (median age 46 years; 78.6% female; 86.9% white; median body mass index 45.9 kg/m(2) ) of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study completed eating behavior survey items in the self-administered LABS-2 Behavior form. Other measures included the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, the LABS-2 Psychiatric and Emotional Test Survey, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12, the Short Form-36 Health Survey, and Impact of Weight Quality of Life-Lite Survey.

RESULTS
The majority (92.1%) of participants reported eating dinner regularly, whereas just over half (54.0%) reported eating breakfast regularly. Half of the participants reported eating at least four meals/week at restaurants; two meals/week were fast food. Loss of control eating was reported by 43.4%, night eating syndrome by 17.7%; 15.7% satisfied criteria for binge eating disorder (BED), 2% for bulimia nervosa. Factors that independently increased the odds of BED were being a college graduate, eating more times per day, taking medication for psychiatric or emotional problems, and having symptoms of alcohol use disorder, lower self-esteem and greater depressive symptoms.

DISCUSSION
Before undergoing bariatric surgery a substantial proportion of patients report problematic eating behaviors. Several factors associated with BED were identified, most suggesting other mental health problems, including higher levels of depressive symptomotology. The strengths of this study include the large sample size, the multi-center design and use of standardized assessment practices.

Negative affect and binge eating: Assessing the unique trajectories of negative affect before and after binge-eating episodes across eating disorder diagnostic classifications.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Binge-eating episodes in individuals with bulimia nervosa are more strongly associated with negative affect than in those with binge-eating disorder, but similar to those in individuals with anorexia nervosa.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies suggest that among individuals who binge eat, emotional states and binge eating are functionally related. However, it is unclear whether the trajectory of negative affect (NA) is the same across diagnostic groups or if specific changes in affect are unique to each diagnostic category. This study examined the moderating effect of diagnosis on the trajectory of negative affect before and after binge eating.

METHOD
Adults with eating disorder diagnoses (anorexia nervosa  = 118, bulimia nervosa  = 133, binge-eating disorder  = 112) completed an EMA where they reported binge eating and negative affect throughout the day. Generalized estimating equation analyses were used to model the trajectories of NA before and after binge eating.

RESULTS
For all individuals, the linear trajectory of NA significantly increased before (B = 0.044, p < .001) and decreased following the binge-eating episode (B = -0.054, p < .001). However, diagnosis moderated this trajectory. Specifically, individuals with BN had a greater change in linear trajectories of NA before (B = 2.305, p < .001) and after (B = -4.149, p < .001) binge eating compared to those with BED, but not those with AN. There were no differences in the trajectory of NA between individuals with BED or AN.

DISCUSSION
These findings suggest that binge-eating episodes in BN may be more strongly associated with NA than in BED, but similar to binge-eating episodes in AN.

Key takeaways:Bariatric surgery can reduce symptoms of Periodic Eating Disorder (BED), but its long-term impact is less clear when combined with other psychiatric disorders.

Abstract:With the increase in the prevalence of obesity in the population over the years, there was an increase in the search for methods of treatment of the same and, consequently, the performance of bariatric surgeries. Eating disorders such as Periodic Eating Disorder (BED) and mood disorders are common in pre-bariatric patients. These disorders may be associated with obesity, either as a cause or as a consequence. Bariatric surgery, on the other hand, may have diverse repercussions on patients' psychiatric disorders by restricting an important 

Regeneration Plate 3.0 – Improvement and Maintenance of Intestinal Health by Reduction of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation

Number of 

Key takeaways:The Regeneration Plate 3.0, placed under the bed during sleep, effectively reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially improving intestinal health and overall well-being.

Abstract:Background: Sleep is an integral biological necessity and is understood to possess recuperative and regenerative properties. Sleep deprivation has been associated with diseases and an increase in morbidity and mortality. Several recent studies have suggested a strong relation between insufficient sleep and gastrointestinal diseases, especially when triggered by inflammatory processes. Accordingly to these findings it has been reported that sleep deprivation in both humans and experimental animals causes a progressive increase in circulating white blood cells, mainly neutrophils as well as an increase in various circulating proinflammatory molecules. Experimental: Against this background we used cultured intestinal epithelial cells to investigate the positive impact of a specially designed device, Regeneration Plate 3.0, which is positioned under the bed during sleep and is stated to improve systemic health on the cellular level by reducing oxidative stress which acts on the body. The plate produces a vital field with a frequency pool containing all important regeneration frequencies within a radius of 90 cm. The body's own energy field only resonates with those frequencies that are required for an optimal supply of energy to the cells. The field strength of the vital field is adjusted in such a way that the energy system cannot be over-energized. In addition, we also used an in vitro model with inflammation-mediating cells (= functional neutrophils) to examine whether the Regeneration Plate 3.0 might be able to reduce the generation of reactive oxygen radicals during an inflammatory process. Results: The results demonstrate that the Regeneration Plate 3.0 was able to reduce oxidative stress acting on intestinal epithelial cells. After 24 hours, the percentage of surviving cells after exposure to 2 mM hydrogen peroxide and the Regeneration Plate 3.0 for 8 hours was 27.7 ± 5.7%, while the viability of the untreated control cells was 14.7 ± 2.9% (mean values ± standard deviations). The difference between both experimental groups was statistically highly significant at the p ≤ 0.01 level. Moreover, the generation of superoxide anion radicals by functional neutrophils was reduced by nearly 50% in comparison to untreated control cells. Again, the difference between both groups was statistically highly significant at the p ≤ 0.01 level. Conclusions: Both beneficial effects of the Regeneration Plate 3.0 shown in the present in vitro study can act on the body during sleep and might enhance not only intestinal health, but also systemic health and well-being.
