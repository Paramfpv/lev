Key takeaways:GHK-Cu and Pal-GHK are effective anti-wrinkle peptides with potential for increased skin permeability through permeation enhancement methodologies.

Abstract:Introduction: Peptides are promising and attractive anti-wrinkle active ingredients, amongst which glycyl-histidyl-lysine peptide (GHK) is one of the most broadly promoted peptide for topical application. This simple sequence of amino acid residues not only has the capability of tissue regeneration and the enhancement of collagen and glycosaminoglycans synthesis but also is able to increase nerve outgrowth and angiogenesis. Consequently, GHK has several properties, from wound healing to prevention/reduction wrinkles. GHK-Cu and Pal-GHK are metal complex and palmitoylated derivatives of GHK, respectively. Although GHK-Cu and Pal-GHK are widely used in anti-wrinkle products available on the cosmetic market, the 

Skin Regenerative and Anti-Cancer Actions of Copper Peptides

Number of 

Key takeaways:Copper peptides, such as GHK-Cu, have potent anti-cancer properties and can improve skin regeneration and appearance.

Abstract:Topical remedies capable of protecting skin from damage and supporting its regeneration can improve skin’s health as well as its appearance. Small copper peptides have an excellent safety record and are widely used in cosmetic products. The most studied copper peptide is GHK-Cu (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine), a small copper-binding peptide, naturally present in human plasma. Since its discovery in 1973, in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that GHK-Cu possesses a wealth of health-positive actions including improving wound contraction and epithelization, and increasing the production of growth factors and activity of antioxidant enzymes. Recently, gene expression profiling shed new light on diverse biological actions of GHK-Cu. The present paper discusses evidence of GHK-Cu and other small copper peptides possessing potent anti-cancer properties.

Enhanced skin penetration of curcumin by a nanoemulsion-embedded oligopeptide hydrogel for psoriasis topical therapy.

Number of 

Key takeaways:The Cur-CNEs/Gel, an oligopeptide hydrogel encapsulating curcumin-loaded nanoemulsions, effectively enhances skin penetration and alleviates psoriasis symptoms in mice.

Abstract:Topical delivery of therapeutics on the skin can effectively alleviate skin symptoms of psoriasis and reduce systemic toxicity. However, the low delivery efficiency caused by the stratum corneum barrier limits the therapeutic impact. Here, we reported an oligopeptide hydrogel that encapsulates cell-penetrating-peptide (CPP)-decorated curcumin-loaded nanoemulsions (Cur-CNEs) to enhance the skin penetration of curcumin for topical treatment of psoriasis. After being applied to the skin of psoriatic mice, the Cur-CNE embedded oligopeptide hydrogel (Cur-CNEs/Gel) provided a prolonged residue time of Cur-CNEs on the skin lesion. The fluidic and elastic properties of the nanoemulsions enabled them to effectively pass through the interstitial spaces of the stratum corneum, while the CPP decoration further enhanced skin penetration and cellular uptake of Cur-CNEs. The Cur-CNEs/Gel exhibits effective alleviation of the symptoms of psoriasis in mice and provides a promising strategy for topical treatment of psoriasis.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oyster protein hydrolysates effectively protect against UVB-induced skin photodamage by promoting antioxidant enzymes, decreasing inflammation, and regulating MMP-1 expression.

Abstract:Chronic exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation is a major cause for skin photoaging. UVB induces damage to skin mainly by oxidative stress, inflammation, and collagen degradation. This paper investigated the photo-protective effects of peptides from oyster (Crassostrea hongkongensis) protein hydrolysates (OPs) by topical application on the skin of UVB-irradiated mice. Results from mass spectrometry showed that OPs consisted of peptides with a molecular weight range of 302.17–2936.43 Da. In vivo study demonstrated that topical application of OPs on the skin significantly alleviated moisture loss, epidermal hyperplasia, as well as degradation of collagen and elastin fibers caused by chronic UVB irradiation. In this study, OPs treatment promoted antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPH-Px) activities, while decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the skin. In addition, OPs treatment significantly decreased inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) content, and inhibited inflammation related (iNOS, COX-2) protein expression in the skin. Via inhibiting metalloproteinase 1(MMP1) expression, OPs treatment markedly decreased the degradation of collagen and elastin fibers as well as recovered the altered arrangement of extracellular matrix network in the dermis of skin. Our study demonstrated for the first time that OPs protected against UVB induced skin photodamage by virtue of its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as regulating the abnormal expression of MMP-1. The possible molecular mechanism underlying OPs anti-photoaging is possibly related to downregulating of the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, while promoting TGF-β production in the skin.

The Innovative and Evolving Landscape of Topical Exosome and Peptide Therapies: A Systematic Review of the Available Literature

Number of 

Key takeaways:Topical exosomes and peptides show promise for skin rejuvenation, with potential for safe and effective treatment in early trials.

Abstract:Abstract   Topical antiaging therapies provide noninvasive delivery of active therapeutics. Exosomes, or extracellular nanovesicles, and peptides, small strings of amino acids, have shown promise as topical therapies in early trials, but neither is FDA approved. This review aims to elucidate the current and future landscape of topical exosomes and peptides as therapeutics for skin rejuvenation. A literature search was conducted using the keywords “peptides” OR “exosomes” AND “skin” OR “rejuvenation.” Primary endpoints included mechanisms of action in humans or live animals as well as clinical data supporting the use of exosomes or peptides topically for skin rejuvenation or wound healing. Secondary endpoints were safety, side effects, and efficacy. The articles were collected, organized, and sorted using the Covidence software (Melbourne, Australia) for systematic review. Nine articles evaluating topical application of exosomes and 9 of peptides met inclusion criteria. Topical exosomes were found to increase collagen deposition, accelerate wound healing, and improve overall cosmesis. Several clinical trials are currently underway. Topical peptides were found to improve appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, elasticity and viscoelasticity, skin texture, skin thickness, and the potential for accelerated wound healing. Peptides are quite common in “cosmeceutical” products, and several patents have been filed for topical peptide products aimed at increasing skin rejuvenation. This could indicate a movement toward pursuing FDA approval. The future of topical exosome and peptide products for the purpose of skin rejuvenation appears promising. Preliminary data from the studies reviewed here indicates that these products have the potential to be safe and effective. Level of Evidence: 3

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral intake of collagen peptide NS, containing Gly-Pro and Pro-Hyp, significantly improves skin hydration, elasticity, desquamation, and wrinkling in women aged 30 to 60 years without causing side effects.

Abstract:Collagen hydrolysate, which contains bioactive peptides, is used as a dietary supplement for the refinement of elasticity, hydration, desquamation, and wrinkling of aging human skin. Here, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled oral administration study on the effects of a collagen peptide (CPNS) containing dipeptides, including Gly-Pro and Pro-Hyp, on skin wrinkling, desquamation, elasticity, and hydration. Our results show that an intake of 1650 mg per day of CPNS for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on skin health in a cohort of women aged from 30 to 60 years (n = 100). Compared with the placebo group, skin desquamation, hydration, skin wrinkling, and elasticity were significantly improved after 4, 4, 12, and 12 weeks of administration, respectively. In a safety test of CPNS ingestion, none of the participants showed any side effects during the clinical study period. These results demonstrate that the low molecular weight bioactive peptides contained in CPNS, such as Gly-Pro and Pro-Hyp, exert positive effects on skin hydration, elasticity, desquamation, and wrinkling.

Collagen Hydrolysates for Skin Protection: Oral Administration and Topical Formulation

Number of 

Key takeaways:Hydrolyzed collagen improves skin elasticity, moisture, and protects against UV melasma, making it a safe and effective antioxidant for both oral and topical use.

Abstract:Antioxidants are molecules that delay or inhibit the oxidation of other molecules. Its use significantly increased in recent years in the diet of people. Natural antioxidants are replacing the use of synthetic antioxidant ingredients due to their safety, nutritional, and therapeutic values. Hydrolyzed collagen (HC) is a popular ingredient considered to be an antioxidant. This low molecular weight protein has been widely utilized due to its excellent biocompatibility, easy biodegradability, and weak antigenicity. It is a safe cosmetic biomaterial with good moisturizing properties on the skin. The antioxidant properties of HC are conditioned to the size of the molecule: the lower the molecular weight of peptides, the greater the ability to donate an electron or hydrogen to stabilize radicals. The antioxidant capacity of HC is mostly due to the presence of hydrophobic amino acids in the peptide. The exact mechanism of peptides acting as antioxidants is not clearly known but some aromatic amino acids and histidine are reported to play an important role in the antioxidant activity. Oral ingestion of HC increases the levels of collagen-derived peptides in the blood torrent and improves the skin properties such as elasticity, skin moisture, and transepidermal water loss. Additionally, daily intakes of HC protect the skin against UV melasma, enhances the fibroblast production and extracellular matrix of the skin. HC has been identified as a safe cosmetic ingredient for topical formulations with good moisturizing properties at the stratum corneum layer of the skin. It reduces the effects of skin aging (dryness, laxity, and wrinkles). The use of HC as a principal ingredient in safe formulations for skin protection was reviewed and compared when it is used by topical and/or oral administration.

Oral Intake of Chicken Bone Collagen Peptides Anti-Skin Aging in Mice by Regulating Collagen Degradation and Synthesis, Inhibiting Inflammation and Activating Lysosomes

Number of 

Key takeaways:Oral intake of chicken bone collagen peptides effectively reduces skin aging in mice by promoting collagen synthesis, inhibiting degradation, and reducing inflammation.

Abstract:The effect of diet on skin aging has become an interesting research topic. Previous studies have mostly focused on the beneficial effects of collagen peptides derived from marine organisms on the aging skin when administered orally, while the beneficial effects of collagen peptides derived from poultry on aging skin have been rarely reported. In this study, collagen peptides were prepared from chicken bone by enzymatic hydrolysis, and the effect and mechanism of action of orally administered collagen peptides on alleviating skin aging induced by UV combined with D-galactose were investigated. The results showed that the chicken bone collagen had typical characteristics of collagen, and the chicken bone collagen peptides (CPs) were mainly small molecular peptides with a molecular weight of <3000 Da. In vivo experiments showed that CPs had a significant relieving effect on aging skin, indicated by the changes in the compostion and structure of the aging skin, improvement of skin antioxidant level, and inhibition of inflammation; the relieving effect was positively correlated with the dose of CPs. Further investigation showed that CPs first reduce the level of skin oxidation, inhibit the expression of the key transcription factor AP-1 (c-Jun and c-Fos), then activate the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway to promote collagen synthesis, inhibit the expression of MMP-1/3 to inhibit collagen degradation, and inhibit skin inflammation to alleviate skin aging in mice. Moreover, the skin transcriptome found that lysosomes activated after oral administration of CPs may be an important pathway for CPs in anti-skin aging, and is worthy of further research. These results suggested that CPs might be used as a functional anti-aging nutritional component.

The topical application of Sphistin12-38 in combination with sponge spicules for the acne treatment.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sph_12-38 combined with sponge spicules effectively treats acne, with a cure rate of 100% in vivo for rabbit ear acne after two weeks.

Abstract:We demonstrated for the first time that a marine-derived antimicrobial peptide (AMP), Sph_12-38, exhibit high antimicrobial activity against P. acnes with a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) value of 7 μM. Meanwhile, Sph_12-38 has no significant cytotoxicity to human keratinocytes (HKs) at its high concentration (33.5 μM). The topical application of sponge Haliclona sp. spicules (SHS) dramatically enhanced the skin penetration of Sph_12-38 up to 40.9 ± 5.9% (p < 0.01), which was 6.1 ± 0.9-fold higher than that of Sph_12-38 alone. Further, SHS resulted in the accumulation of most Sph_12-38 in viable epidermis and dermis. Further, the combined use of Sph_12-38 and SHS resulted in a cure rate of 100% for rabbit ear acne treatment in vivo for two weeks, while the one induced by other groups was 40%, 0% and 0% for SHS alone, Sph_12-38 alone and control group, respectively. The strategy of combined using AMP and SHS can also be applied in a rational designed topical delivery system for the management of other deep infection of the skin. The effectiveness of SHS by itself on the treatment of acne was also demonstrated by clinical trials. After 14 days of treatment by 1% SHS gel. The number of skin lesions decreased by 51.4%.Graphical Abstract

Development and Challenges of Antimicrobial Peptides for Therapeutic Applications

Number of 

Key takeaways:Antimicrobial peptides show potential as therapeutic drugs, but their stability and toxicity require understanding their mechanisms and effects on the human body.

Abstract:More than 3000 antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been discovered, seven of which have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Now commercialized, these seven peptides have mostly been utilized for topical medications, though some have been injected into the body to treat severe bacterial infections. To understand the translational potential for AMPs, we analyzed FDA-approved drugs in the FDA drug database. We examined their physicochemical properties, secondary structures, and mechanisms of action, and compared them with the peptides in the AMP database. All FDA-approved AMPs were discovered in Gram-positive soil bacteria, and 98% of known AMPs also come from natural sources (skin secretions of frogs and toxins from different species). However, AMPs can have undesirable properties as drugs, including instability and toxicity. Thus, the design and construction of effective AMPs require an understanding of the mechanisms of known peptides and their effects on the human body. This review provides an overview to guide the development of AMPs that can potentially be used as antimicrobial drugs.

Key takeaways:Advanced Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Protein Extract (AAPE) activates human keratinocyte proliferation and migration, highlighting its potential for skin regeneration treatment.

Abstract:The beneficial effects of adipose-derived stem cell conditioned medium (ADSC-CM) on skin regeneration have been reported. Although the mechanism of how ADSC-CM promotes skin regeneration is unclear, ADSC-CM contained various growth factors and it is an excellent raw material for skin treatment. ADSC-CM produced in a hypoxia condition of ADSC—in other words, Advanced Adipose-Derived Stem cell Protein Extract (AAPE)—has great merits for skin regeneration. In this study, human primary keratinocytes (HKs), which play fundamental roles in skin tissue, was used to examine how AAPE affects HK. HK proliferation was significantly higher in the experimental group (1.22 μg/mL) than in the control group. DNA gene chip demonstrated that AAPE in keratinocytes (p < 0.05) notably affected expression of 290 identified transcripts, which were associated with cell proliferation, cycle and migration. More keratinocyte wound healing and migration was shown in the experimental group (1.22 μg/mL). AAPE treatment significantly stimulated stress fiber formation, which was linked to the RhoA-ROCK pathway. We identified 48 protein spots in 2-D gel analysis and selected proteins were divided into 64% collagen components and 30% non-collagen components as shown by the MALDI-TOF analysis. Antibody array results contained growth factor/cytokine such as HGF, FGF-1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, VEGF, and TGF-β3 differing from that shown by 2-D analysis. Conclusion: AAPE activates HK proliferation and migration. These results highlight the potential of the topical application of AAPE in the treatment of skin regeneration.
