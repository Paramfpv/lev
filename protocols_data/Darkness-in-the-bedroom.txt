Darkness in the bedroom

Better sleep quality and recovery – a simple effect of darkness in the bedroom

Darkness in the bedroom significantly improves sleep quality in both adults and children. Limiting exposure to light at night leads to faster sleep onset, fewer awakenings, and deeper recovery, as confirmed by numerous clinical and observational studies.

Level of evidence:Strong

Level of risk:Negligible

Darkness in the bedroom supports the body's natural circadian rhythm by allowing optimal melatonin production – the hormone that regulates sleep. The absence of artificial light at night helps the body transition more quickly into deep sleep, extends its duration, and enhances restfulness. Sleeping in darkness promotes better physical and mental recovery and supports metabolic health and overall bodily balance.

Level of risk:Negligible

Sleeping in darkness is considered very safe and well-tolerated by most of the population. No serious adverse effects associated with this intervention have been reported in the literature.

Sleeping in complete darkness is not recommended for individuals with severe nyctophobia (fear of the dark) or those who feel uncomfortable without a light source in the bedroom.

Total darkness in the bedroom throughout the night; ideally eliminate all light sources, even those with low intensity.

Natural darkness (curtains, blinds), eye mask, absence of light-emitting devices.

Initial improvements in sleep may be felt within a few nights, with full effects after 1–2 weeks.

Darkness should be maintained throughout the entire night, from bedtime to wake-up.

Regular sleep schedule, winding down before bed, avoiding blue light exposure before sleep.

How to eliminate light in the bedroom

Use blackout blinds or thick curtains, turn off all light sources (including LED lights), and use an eye mask if needed.

Limit blue light exposure before bed

Avoid using phones, tablets, or TVs 1–2 hours before bed; install blue light filters on devices.

Gradual adaptation to darkness

If you feel discomfort, gradually reduce the intensity of night light until you achieve complete darkness.

If you need to get up at night, consider using a soft night light with a motion sensor that doesn’t shine directly into the eyes and doesn’t disrupt melatonin production.

Eye mask as an alternative

For people who can’t fully darken their bedroom, an eye mask is an effective, affordable, and practical solution.

Darkness in the bedroom significantly improves sleep quality by increasing sleep efficiency, shortening sleep onset, reducing the number of awakenings, and enhancing overall recovery.

Final comment:The impact of darkness in the bedroom on sleep quality is supported by a range of high-quality studies, including meta-analyses on large populations, as well as randomized interventional and observational studies. The results of these studies are consistent and clear – exposure to light at night significantly impairs sleep parameters, while sleeping in darkness improves its quality. Effects have been observed in both subjective and objective sleep measures, and the effectiveness of this intervention has been demonstrated across age groups, including children and adults. These findings are characterized by high reliability and large sample sizes, placing them among the strongest in the scientific hierarchy.

The Influence of Lighting on The Bedroom Towards The Sleep Quality of Children Aged 0-5 Years

Number of 

Key takeaways:Bedroom lighting has a significant impact on the sleep quality of children aged 0-5 years, reducing total awakenings by an average of 2 fewer awakenings per night.

Abstract:Lighting in the bedroom is important in maintaining the quality of children's sleep. At the age of 0-5 years, a child has a sleep duration of around 11-18 hours, so it is necessary to pay attention to the lighting in the bedroom so that children have quality sleep time. This study aims to determine the effect of lighting in the bedroom on the sleep quality of children aged 0-5 years. Samples were taken randomly with the age range of children 0-5 years with the criteria of children accustomed to sleeping with the lights off as many as 6 samples.  The number of samples was adjusted to the availability of samples around the research site in Tinjomoyo village. Data collection techniques were observation and questionnaires. The parents of the sample filled out the observation sheets and questionnaires. The duration of data collection depends on how many times each sample wakes up during sleep at night, starting when the child falls asleep until 03.00 AM. The results showed that there was an effect of bedroom lighting on the sleep quality of children aged 0-5 years as indicated by a change in the child's total awakening, which is an average of 2 fewer awakenings during sleep from the lights on to the lights off.

Exploring the effects of spectral light exposure on University students' sleep quality: A cross-sectional study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher spectral light exposure in university students' bedrooms may shorten the duration of deep sleep, but further research is needed.

Abstract:In developed nations, 2/3 of the population fail to obtain the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep, with large consequences for health and productivity. A potent stimulus in regulating sleep and wake balance is light received at a light-sensitive retinal protein called melanopsin, found in our retinal cells, otherwise known as intrinsically retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Hence, to better understand the effects of bedroom indoor environmental quality IEQ on sleep, we set up a study to objectively explore the impact of spectral light exposure through non-visual pathways on the participants' sleep quality. For one week, University students measured IEQ in their bedrooms while monitoring their spectral light exposure during the day and sleep quality at night. The students were asked to keep the bedroom environment unchanged for the measurement period. Our preliminary results show trends between 7-day accumulative light exposure and length of deep sleep. This trend is not significant, and further in-depth analysis is needed. Among other limitations in the processed data, the diverse and mixed demographic of the sample was not considered. The students' living conditions (single vs. family, accommodation, etc.) varied in this initial analysis.

Window/door opening‐mediated bedroom ventilation and its impact on sleep quality of healthy, young adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Open window or door in a bedroom improves sleep quality and reduces awakenings, while closed window or door in a bedroom may cause increased CO2 levels and slightly cooler temperatures.

Abstract:This work examined window/door opening as means of bedroom ventilation and the consequent effect upon occupants' sleep, using data from 17 healthy volunteers. Bedroom CO2 level, temperature, and relative humidity were measured over 5 days, for two cases: open window or door (internal, bedroom door), and closed window and door. Participant filled questionnaires and sleep diary provided subjective measure of sleep quality. Actigraphy objectively monitored the participants during sleep. Additionally, a FlexSensor, placed under pillows of participants, detected movement during sleep. Average CO2 level for the Open conditions was 717 ppm (SD = 197 ppm) and for Closed conditions was 1150 ppm (SD = 463 ppm). Absolute humidity levels were similar for both conditions, while Open conditions were slightly cooler (mean = 19.7°C, SD = 1.8°C) than Closed (mean = 20.1°C, SD = 1.5°C). Results showed significant correlations (P < .001) between actigraphy data and questionnaire responses for: sleep latency (r = .45), sleep length (r = .87), and number of awakenings (r = .28). Of all analyzed sleep parameters, questionnaire-based depth of sleep (P = .002) and actigraphy-based sleep phase (P = .003) were significantly different between Open and Closed conditions.

Associations between psychological responses under artificial light environment and sleep activity

Number of 

Key takeaways:Artificial lights at 2700K in bedrooms can provide relaxation and mood, with 67% of the variation in sleep quality explained by pre-sleep relaxation and pleasure.

Abstract:Light helps mankind synchronize the circadian rhythm, necessitating the need to create a luminous environment in a bedroom. Many studies have focused on the effect of bedroom lighting regulation on sleep. However, there was a lack of research on how psychology responses are connected to sleep in residential bedroom. Thus, this chamber-based study explored mood differences among three correlated color temperatures (CCT; 2700 K, 4100 K, 5500 K). Additionally, the study analyzed the correlation of pre- and post-sleep psychological states with sleep quality. The results showed that suitable artificial lights (CCT at 2700K) in a bedroom before and after sleep under different conditions would provide the relaxation for subjects. Moreover, SOL, SWS, and SE were significantly different across different CCTs. According to the correlation and regression analysis, there were four groups of Pearson significantly correlated variables with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.34 to 0.70. Among them, 67% of the variation in SOL could be explained by the degree of pre sleep relaxation and pleasure. Furthermore, abundant and healthy sleep might perpetuate the mood generated by artificial lights. Finally, the roles of psychological states and sleep physiological responses should be considered while creating comfortable lighting conditions in bedrooms.

The effects of bedroom air quality on sleep and next-day performance.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Lowering CO2 levels in bedroom ventilation significantly improves sleep quality, perceived freshness, and next-day mental performance.

Abstract:The effects of bedroom air quality on sleep and next-day performance were examined in two field-intervention experiments in single-occupancy student dormitory rooms. The occupants, half of them women, could adjust an electric heater to maintain thermal comfort but they experienced two bedroom ventilation conditions, each maintained for 1 week, in balanced order. In the initial pilot experiment (N = 14), bedroom ventilation was changed by opening a window (the resulting average CO2 level was 2585 or 660 ppm). In the second experiment (N = 16), an inaudible fan in the air intake vent was either disabled or operated whenever CO2 levels exceeded 900 ppm (the resulting average CO2 level was 2395 or 835 ppm). Bedroom air temperatures varied over a wide range but did not differ between ventilation conditions. Sleep was assessed from movement data recorded on wristwatch-type actigraphs and subjects reported their perceptions and their well-being each morning using online questionnaires. Two tests of next-day mental performance were applied. Objectively measured sleep quality and the perceived freshness of bedroom air improved significantly when the CO2 level was lower, as did next-day reported sleepiness and ability to concentrate and the subjects' performance of a test of logical thinking.

Associations of bedroom air temperature and CO2 concentration with subjective perceptions and sleep quality during transition seasons.

Number of 

Key takeaways:A slightly warm pre-sleep environment and high ventilation with low indoor CO2 concentration in naturally ventilated bedrooms during transition seasons improves sleep quality for residents.

Abstract:This field study aimed to investigate naturally ventilated bedroom environment and its effects on subjective perception and sleep quality. Totally, 104 healthy subjects living in urban areas of Beijing participated in the study for one night during transition seasons. Bedroom environment parameters, including temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration, were recorded before and during sleep. Objective sleep quality was measured by Fitbit Alta 2, a wrist-type actigraphy sensor. Subjective assessments were collected by paper-based questionnaires on sleep quality and environmental perceptions. The results showed that neutral temperature for waking state (before sleep) was estimated to be 23.8°C while for sleep state it was 26.5°C. Furthermore, pre-sleep thermal sensation vote was found to be positively correlated with deep sleep percentage. Indoor air quality was correlated with sleep quality as indicated by statistically significant correlations between odor intensity assessment, air quality acceptability, average nightly CO2 concentration, and measures of sleep quality. For naturally ventilated bedrooms during transition seasons with a mild outdoor climate, present findings suggest that a bedroom with slightly warm pre-sleep environment than neutral, and with high ventilation as indicated by low indoor CO2 concentration, could be beneficial for sleep quality of residents.

Experimental study on effect of background noise on deep sleep in bedroom

Number of 

Key takeaways:Deep sleep length increases at 31 dBA, with the best value being around this level, and decreases below this level due to excessive quietness.

Abstract:One of the most important external factors for sleep quality is noise. Previous studies show that deep sleep is disturbed strongly by noise, resulting in insufficient cerebral cortex deep resting, in delaying the growth and development, and in reducing immunity and brain functions. In the past, all the research studies added artificial noise into the bedroom, and how background noise affects sleep was still unknown. In this paper, the difference in the deep sleep length between the normal bedroom and the 0-dB(A) silence room which excludes the background noise during subject’s sleep was compared. Continuously two night sleeps of 35 random subjects, wearing the EEG brainwave Zeo headband, were recorded, one in the silence room and another in subject’s self-home bedroom. The result shows that comparing 29–35 dBA with the 0 dB extreme silence condition, deep sleep length increased. The best value locates about 31 dBA, which may be related to the masking of breathing sounds. Below 31 dBA, with noise reducing, the deep sleep length is reduced because of the excessive quietness reduces the masking effect, highlighting the effects of incidental noise. Between 31 and 48 dBA, as the noise increases, the length of deep sleep would decrease, by 4% for each additional 1 dB noise.

The Influence of Bedroom CO2 Concentration on Sleep Quality

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher CO2 concentrations in a bedroom lead to reduced sleep quality, including quietness, satisfaction, and duration, as well as increased discomfort and awakenings.

Abstract:A person spends about a third of their life sleeping, and high sleep quality is very important for health. Environmental factors are one of the most important factors affecting sleep quality, and indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration while sleeping has a significant effect on sleep quality. In an indoor bedroom with no open windows and no fresh air system, different numbers of people sleeping will lead to changes in indoor CO2 concentration. In order to study the changes in sleep quality caused by differences in CO2 concentration, experimental research was performed. Objective sleep quality data are collected with polysomnography (PSG) and a subjective questionnaire. The sleep quality of the subjects is tested under three different CO2 concentration levels; the average carbon dioxide concentration of three conditions is 680, 920, and 1350 ppm, which simulate a room with 1, 2, and 3 people sleeping, respectively. Other environment parameters are controlled as follows: test environment temperature is 26 ± 0.5 °C, relative humidity is 50 ± 5%, there is no obvious heat source in the test room, and the radiation temperature and air temperature difference is less than 1 °C. A total of 30 subjective tests were carried out with 10 subjects; the test lasted more than one month. The data subsequently underwent statistical analysis to determine the influence of CO2 concentration on sleep quality. The results show that as the CO2 concentration level increased, the sleep quietness and satisfaction of the subjects gradually decreased, the sleep duration gradually decreased, and symptoms such as throat discomfort, dyspnea, dry and itchy skin, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty waking up, congested nose and bad air smell become more obvious. The PSG test results showed that CO2 concentration has a significant impact on the proportion of the N3 period. According to the group of CO2 concentration conditions, the mean of the N3 period proportion under the conditions of one person, two persons, and three persons is 20.4%, 17.3%, and 14.4%, respectively. Finally, there was also an increase in turning over or awakening during sleep, indicating that sleep quality was reduced under higher CO2 concentrations.

Associations of bedroom temperature and ventilation with sleep quality

Number of 

Key takeaways:Bedroom temperature negatively impacts sleep efficiency and REM sleep, while bedroom CO2 concentration negatively affects deep sleep percentage, with air freshness also negatively impacting sleep quality.

Abstract:Sleep is essential for the body to recover from both physical and psychological fatigue accruing throughout the day, and to restore energy to maintain bodily functions. Bedroom environmental quality is one of the key causes of sleep disturbance, so a better understanding of the associations of bedroom temperature and ventilation rate (using CO2 as the surrogate) with sleep quality is necessary. This field study was conducted during summer in subtropical Sydney, Australia, with a sample of 48 householders, including both males and females. In addition to a questionnaire-based subjective sleep quality scales, sleep metrics were also monitored using wrist-wearable sensors. An indoor environmental quality monitoring station (SAMBA) was installed in each survey bedroom for continuous measurements of thermal and air quality parameters at 5-minute intervals for five consecutive days for each subject. The thermal sensation subjects used to characterize their night’s sleep showed no relationship with the actual thermal conditions prevailing in the bedroom while sleeping. Sleep efficiency (ratio of time asleep to time in bed) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (%) were both negatively correlated with bedroom operative temperature; as bedroom operative temperature increases by 1 K, the estimate of sleep efficiency and REM sleep percentage decrease by 1.036% and 1.647%, respectively. Deep sleep percentage was negatively related to bedroom CO2 concentration, with a 4.3% decrement for every 100 ppm increase in the overnight mean CO2 concentration. The deterioration in subjectively evaluated air freshness was associated with poorer self-reported sleep quality. The effect of bedroom CO2 concentration on light sleep percentage varied significantly under different bedroom operative temperature levels.

Effects of window opening on the bedroom environment and resulting sleep quality

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sleeping with windows open can improve air quality and reduce CO2 concentrations, but may result in higher noise levels and discomfort if there are loud noise events outdoors.

Abstract:The effects of two window states (closed or open) on the bedroom environment and on sleep quality were investigated. Twenty-seven subjects (14 males and 13 females, 20–33 years old) without sleep disorders and chronic diseases participated. The subjects slept for two consecutive nights with windows open and two consecutive nights with windows closed in four dormitory rooms adapted for the purpose of this study, one person at a time. The order of exposure was balanced among participants. Bed temperature, room temperature, relative humidity (RH), carbon dioxide (CO2), particles (PM2.5), and noise were monitored during sleep. Sleep quality was measured using subjective ratings, a wrist-worn sleep tracker, and (for one group of 14 subjects only) polysomnography (PSG) for home use; snoring in this sub-group and awakenings were also registered. Higher PM2.5 and noise levels were found with windows open, while higher room temperature, RH, and CO2 levels were measured with windows closed. There were no differences between conditions in terms of objectively measured sleep stages but the subjects with the PSG attached snored significantly less and woke up significantly less often when sleeping with windows open. Start sleep time, end sleep time, total sleep time (TST) and time in bed (TIB) measured with the sleep tracker were confirmed by the measurements made using PSG, light sleep (N1 + N2) and sleep latency were in moderate agreement but there was no significant agreement for REM and deep sleep (N3). When sleeping with windows open, the subjects rated the air as fresher but reported higher noise levels, feeling less rested, a worse mental state and well-being, and their replies on the Groningen sleep quality scale indicated poorer sleep quality. There was no clear association between the performance test score and sleep quality. These results suggest that sleeping with windows open can provide some benefits by increasing ventilation with outdoor air, reducing CO2 concentrations, improving air quality as indicated by the subjectively rated air freshness and some of the parameters defining sleep quality, but it may also result in some discomfort if there are episodic loud noise events outdoors. Further studies are required to clarify the role of open windows in achieving good sleep quality.

Key takeaways:Sleeping in the dark significantly improves sleep quality and fitness in 4th year medical students at Unisba, possibly due to optimized melatonin production.

Abstract:Sleep is a state where the body experiences active unconsciousness, at this time the brain is in a relative rest phase but will remain reactive to internal stimuli. Sleeping in the dark can increase melatonin which affects sleep quality and results in fitness later. This study aims to see the effect of sleeping in the dark on sleep quality and fitness in 4th year medical students Bandung Islamic University. This study is experimental by comparing sleep quality and fitness when sleeping in light and dark conditions. The study was conducted on 42 students of Faculty of Medicine, Unisba. The students previously slept in light conditions and their sleep quality and fitness were measured after being asked to sleep in the dark with a special eye mask for 2 weeks. Sleep quality was assessed using the PSQI questionnaire that were translated in Indonesian language. The results of the study found that there was a significant difference in sleep quality (p<0.01). Sleeping in the dark can lead to good sleep quality might be because melatonin production is optimized, helping us fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.
