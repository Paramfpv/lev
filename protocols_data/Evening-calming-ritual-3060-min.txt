HARM LEVEL: Abstract:According to the CDC, most children and about 1 in 3 adults in the United States fail to reach their age group recommended quantity of sleep. Recently, non‐pharmacological sleep aids, such as meditation, have gained popularity. However, to our knowledge there is no research data that compares sleep metrics or psychological well‐being between those that meditate in the morning vs. in the evening. This study aims to investigate the potential circadian‐dependent effects of meditation timing and how it may influence metrics of sleep and psychological well‐being. We hypothesized that those who meditate just before sleep would have improved sleep parameters and self‐reported feelings of psychological well‐being when compared to those that meditate in the morning. Sixteen college students participated in the study, eight who meditated in the morning (5M; 3F) after waking and eight who meditated in the evening (4M; 4F) just before going to sleep. Participants were asked to wear an Actiwatch Spectrum PRO to evaluate physical activity and sleep throughout the recording periods. The first phase of the protocol consisted of a 4‐day (Monday‐Thursday) baseline recording period where total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency measures were recorded. Participants were instructed to not meditate during the baseline period. During the 4‐day intervention period which occurred the following week (Monday‐Thursday), participants were randomized to a 24‐minute pre‐sleep or morning mindfulness meditation intervention from the app Insight Timer. At the conclusion of both baseline and intervention time periods (on Friday of each respective week), participants were instructed to complete a state‐trait anxiety inventory (STAI), a Five Facts of Mindfulness Questionnaire, and a Decentering Questionnaire. Means were considered to be significantly different when p<0.05. The acute meditation protocols did not significantly change TST from baseline in the morning (6.7±0.2 vs. 6.8±0.2 hours) or evening (6.9±0.3 vs. 7.2±0.2 hours) meditators. Likewise, sleep efficiency was not significantly changed in either group. However, there was a significant decrease in both state and trait anxiety (baseline vs. treatment, p<0.02 for both), and a significant increase in the five facets of mindfulness and ability to decenter (baseline vs. treatment, p<0.01 for both). Our preliminary results suggest that acute meditation can help to improve several measures of psychological well‐being whether it is done in the morning or evening. Further investigation within our own study and from others may help to better understand whether evening meditation can offer specific sleep benefits.

Level of evidence:Strong

Level of risk:Negligible

Meditation and relaxation affect the nervous system by reducing sympathetic activity and increasing parasympathetic activity, leading to lower stress levels and muscle tension. Mindfulness techniques enhance awareness and the ability to regulate emotions, which decreases anxiety and improves sleep quality. Limiting environmental stimuli promotes faster falling asleep and deeper sleep, while regularity of rituals strengthens their regenerative effects.

Level of risk:Negligible

Evening calming rituals, such as meditation and relaxation techniques, are generally well tolerated by most people. However, mild side effects may occur, especially in beginners or those with mental health disorders.

Evening calming rituals are not recommended for people with severe mental disorders without specialist supervision, as well as for individuals with serious somatic conditions that may hinder relaxation or the performance of techniques.

Self-compassion, meaning in life, and experiential avoidance explain the relationship between meditation and positive mental health outcomes.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Meditation positively impacts mental health through increased self-compassion, meaning in life, and reduced experiential avoidance.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
Despite consistent evidence for the beneficial effects of meditation on mental health, little is known about the mechanisms that make mindfulness meditation effective.

METHOD
The levels of mental health, self-compassion, presence of meaning in life, and experiential avoidance of meditators (n = 414) and nonmeditators (n = 414) were measured and compared. Bootstrap-based structural equation modeling (SEM) modeling analyses were used to test multiple-step multiple-mediator models.

RESULTS
Meditation was positively associated with mental health, although the regularity of practice was an influential element to be considered. Significant indirect effects of meditation on mental health through self-compassion, meaning in life, and experiential avoidance were found. SEM models were able to account for 58% of the variance in mental health scores.

CONCLUSIONS
Self-compassion, presence of meaning in life, and reduced experiential avoidance may be active components of healthy meditation practices. Identifying the mechanisms involved in effective meditation practices has relevant implications for well-being and mental health-promoting interventions.

THE CONCEPT OF TAHAJUD PRAYER THROUGH PSYCHOTHERAPY APPROACH IN RELATIONSHIP WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH

Number of 

Key takeaways:Tahajjud prayers, performed at the end of a quiet night, can increase mental calm, reduce heart disease risk, and increase life expectancy.

Abstract:Religion and its practices have been duly implicated in treating not only problems related to medical health, rather, intervening and preventing such problems as well. In the present article, the authors have reviewed the significance of Tahajjud prayers in healthcare and mental health in particular. The study uses a qualitative research design in which the data collection using library research approach. The result shows that tahajjud prayer performed at the end of a quiet night can bring calm. While calm it proves to increase immunologic body resistance, reduce the risk of heart disease and increase life expectancy. Conversely, forms of mental stress such as stress and depression make a person vulnerable to various diseases, infections and accelerate the development of cancer cells and increase metastasis in (cancer cell spread). Precious and sincere tahajjud prayer influence a healthy mentality especially providing benefits in terms of psychic feelings of calm and serenity, it can also provide great benefits on physical health.

The Impact of Morning Meditation and Sleep Quality on Affective and Health Outcomes in Healthcare Workers

Number of 

Key takeaways:Morning meditation improves mental health and vitality in healthcare workers, with poor sleep quality affecting this relationship.

Abstract:Background: Health is a critical factor influencing key workplace outcomes, including job attitudes, behaviors, and performance. This study investigated the role of daily micro-breaks, specifically morning meditation practices, and positive affective experiences (i.e., positive affect) at work in predicting health-related outcomes, namely vitality and mental health. Using a non-experimental design, this study tested a moderated mediation model in which sleep quality moderates the relationship between morning meditation and positive affect, which, in turn, predicts end-of-the-day health-related outcomes. Methodology: Data were collected twice a day from 44 healthcare employees over five consecutive workdays using a daily survey approach. Key Results: Multilevel modeling analyses revealed that morning meditation was significantly associated with increased positive affect and improved health indicators at the end of the workday. Moreover, sleep quality moderated the relationship between morning meditation and positive affect, such that the conditional indirect effect of meditation on end-of-day mental health and vitality via positive affect was significant when sleep quality from the preceding night was poor. Conclusions: These findings underscore the interactive effect of prior-night sleep quality and morning meditation on affective and health-related outcomes by the end of the day. By identifying sleep quality as a key boundary condition, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of when meditation is most beneficial. Our findings have significant implications for both research and practice, particularly in high-stress environments such as healthcare, where optimizing employee well-being is crucial for both individual and organizational performance.

Mind-Body Practices and the Self: Yoga and Meditation Do Not Quiet the Ego but Instead Boost Self-Enhancement

Number of 

Key takeaways:Yoga and meditation do not fully quiet the ego; instead, they boost self-enhancement, despite their well-being benefits.

Abstract:Mind-body practices enjoy immense public and scientific interest. Yoga and meditation are highly popular. Purportedly, they foster well-being by curtailing self-enhancement bias. However, this “ego-quieting” effect contradicts an apparent psychological universal, the self-centrality principle. According to this principle, practicing any skill renders that skill self-central, and self-centrality breeds self-enhancement bias. We examined those opposing predictions in the first tests of mind-body practices’ self-enhancement effects. In Experiment 1, we followed 93 yoga students over 15 weeks, assessing self-centrality and self-enhancement bias after yoga practice (yoga condition, n = 246) and without practice (control condition, n = 231). In Experiment 2, we followed 162 meditators over 4 weeks (meditation condition: n = 246; control condition: n = 245). Self-enhancement bias was higher in the yoga (Experiment 1) and meditation (Experiment 2) conditions, and those effects were mediated by greater self-centrality. Additionally, greater self-enhancement bias mediated mind-body practices’ well-being benefits. Evidently, neither yoga nor meditation fully quiet the ego; to the contrary, they boost self-enhancement.

The Effects of Morning vs. Evening Mindfulness Meditation on Sleep, Anxiety, and Decentering: A Pilot Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Mindfulness meditation, whether done in the morning or evening, can improve psychological well-being and decrease anxiety, but does not significantly change sleep parameters or sleep efficiency.

The moderating role of dispositional mindfulness in the associations of morningness‐eveningness with depressive and anxiety symptoms

Number of 

Key takeaways:Dispositional mindfulness may act as a protective factor against the elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms in evening-oriented individuals.

Abstract:Several studies have shown that eveningness is positively related to both depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, little is known about factors that may play a protective role against the undesirable emotional consequences of evening preference. Thus, in the present study, we explored the moderating effects of dispositional mindfulness on the relationship between morningness‐eveningness and the presence of depressive symptoms, as well as between morningness‐eveningness and the presence of anxiety symptoms. The study was conducted on a group of 1107 individuals (559 women and 548 men) aged 18–55 years (M = 36.26, SD = 9.89). Consistent with previous findings, eveningness was positively related to the presence of both depressive and anxiety symptoms. The magnitude of these effects decreased with higher dispositional mindfulness. The latter result remained significant when the analogical moderating effects of personality, established in earlier studies, were controlled for in the regression models. This leads to the conclusion that dispositional mindfulness may act as a protective factor against the elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms reported by evening‐oriented individuals.

'Did you have a nice evening?' A day-level study on recovery experiences, sleep, and affect.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Low psychological detachment from work in the evening leads to negative activation and fatigue, while mastery experiences and relaxation improve positive activation and serenity the next morning.

Abstract:In this study, the authors used a within-person design to examine the relation between recovery experiences (psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery experiences) during leisure time, sleep, and affect in the next morning. Daily survey data gathered over the course of 1 work week from 166 public administration employees analyzed with a hierarchical linear modeling approach showed that low psychological detachment from work during the evening predicted negative activation and fatigue, whereas mastery experiences during the evening predicted positive activation and relaxation predicted serenity. Sleep quality showed relations with all affective states variables. This study adds to research on job-stress recovery and affect regulation by showing which specific experiences from the nonwork domain may improve affect before the start of the next working day.

Dispositional mindfulness as a protective factor: Longitudinal effects on the relationship between morningness-eveningness, affective functioning, and depressive and anxiety symptoms

Number of 

Key takeaways:Dispositional mindfulness can moderate the link between eveningness and higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, but not positive affect, over a year.

Abstract:Multiple research shows that morningness-eveningness is associated with affective functioning. Specifically, eveningness is associated with lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and higher mental health problems, while morningness shows the opposite correlation. Previous research indicated how the negative consequences of eveningness may be modified by individuals' psychological characteristics, such as personality and temperamental traits, or religiosity. Additionally, research indicated that dispositional mindfulness may act as a protective factor against higher depressive and anxiety symptoms among evening types. The present study explores the longitudinal effects of dispositional mindfulness on these relationships, extending the investigation to examine its impact on positive and negative affect. The study was conducted on a group of 660 individuals (319 women and 341 men) aged 19-55 (M ± SD: 38.08 ± 9.60), with data collected annually. The results showed that eveningness is associated with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as negative affect, and lower mindfulness and positive affect. Furthermore, the findings indicated that higher dispositional mindfulness moderated the link between eveningness and depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as negative affect, over one year. However, this moderation effect did not extend to a positive affect. These results suggest that engaging in mindfulness practices to cultivate and strengthen mindfulness may be beneficial as a supplementary approach in the therapeutic process for evening types. Additionally, the results provide the first evidence of a longitudinal effect of dispositional mindfulness on the relationship between morningness-eveningness and features of mental health and affect.

Morningness-eveningness and mental health: Initial evidence of the moderating roles of mattering and anti-mattering

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eveningness is negatively associated with mattering and positively associated with anti-mattering, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, with feelings of importance and value potentially buffering against these negative effects.

Abstract:ABSTRACT Mental health problems are more prevalent in evening-oriented individuals than in their morning-oriented counterparts. Recently, research has offered first insights into how the negative effects of eveningness on mental health and well-being can be magnified or alleviated depending on accompanying psychological characteristics. In the current study, we evaluated how eveningness relates to mattering and anti-mattering and whether mattering and anti-mattering can moderate the association between eveningness and mental health. The participants were 692 Polish adults (337 women, 355 men) aged between 21 and 57 years (M ± SD: 39.76 ± 9.63). All participants completed measures of morningness-eveningness and depressive and anxiety symptoms, the General Mattering Scale (GMS) and the Anti-Mattering Scale (AMS). Conducted analyses showed that 1) the Polish versions of GMS and AMS have appropriate reliability and validity, 2) eveningness is negatively associated with mattering and positively associated with anti-mattering, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, and 3) the magnitude of the association between eveningness and mental health symptoms increased with higher anti-mattering and lower mattering. Overall, this study presents the first evidence of how feelings of being important and being valued may buffer against the negative effects of eveningness on mental health.

Quiet time via transcendental meditation in secondary school pupils with special educational needs: effects on well-being and behaviour

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regular Quiet Time via Transcendental Meditation in secondary school pupils with special educational needs showed no significant effect on well-being or behavior, despite high attendance.

Abstract:ABSTRACT This paper describes effects on wellbeing as well as logistical difficulties of implementing regular Quiet Time (QT) via Transcendental Meditation (TM) among mainstream secondary school pupils with special educational needs, age 12–16 measured via a pilot Randomised Control Trial (RCT). Participants were recruited from three mainstreams and one special school for children with autism and randomly allocated to QT (n = 17) or a Carry on as Usual (n = 16) control group. On average, the QT pupils attended only 2.7 meditation sessions per week, far fewer than the 10 sessions per week encouraged, despite TM being well liked. Pupils reported conflicting demands during TM time preventing regular attendance. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed no significant interactions between group and time. Within the QT group, higher attendance was associated with reductions in teacher-rated externalising difficulties, but these effects were mainly driven by the four pupils who attended more than 60% of the QT sessions. The main analysis revealed no significant effect of QT. The need for further feasibility work to establish and test strategies for promoting engagement with meditation strategies in busy secondary school environments is clear.

Blame it on the “night owls”: Perceived discrimination partly mediates the effects of morningness‐eveningness on positive and negative affect

Number of 

Key takeaways:Evening preference is linked to negative stereotypes and social stigma, which partly mediate the negative effects of morningness-eveningness on positive and negative emotions.

Abstract:The well‐established effects of evening preference on diminished well‐being and poorer mental health are usually explained in terms of common genetic bases of eveningness and negative emotionality and/or the discrepancy between biological and social clocks, experienced far more frequently by the Evening‐types. However, recent studies provide evidence for the negative stereotyping of evening chronotypes which may lead to unexpectedly pronounced social stigma and its consequences. The present article provides a seminal empirical analysis of the role of perceived chronotype‐related discrimination in the association between morningness‐eveningness and both positive affect and negative affect. The study was conducted on a gender‐balanced sample of 768 individuals aged between 18 and 56 years who filled measures of morningness‐eveningness, positive and negative affect, as well as a modified version of the Perceived Devaluation Discrimination scale, tentatively labeled Perceived Chronotype‐Related Discrimination scale ( developed to measure the sense of chronotype‐based discrimination. Conducted analyses provided evidence for a positive association between eveningness and perceived discrimination. Moreover, perceived discrimination partly mediated the associations between morningness‐eveningness and both positive affect and negative affect, explaining 18% and 29% of these effects, respectively. Hence, our results provide initial evidence for yet another mechanism through which chronotype may impact emotional functioning, namely the experience of chronotype‐based stigmatisation.

Effects of Extreme Ritual Practices on Psychophysiological Well-Being

Number of 

Key takeaways:Extreme ritual practices, such as bodily mutilation and prolonged suffering, can improve subjective health without negatively impacting physiological health, with greater benefits for those engaging in more intense forms of participation.

Abstract:Extreme ritual practices involving pain and suffering pose significant risks such as injury, trauma, or infection. Nonetheless, they are performed by millions of people around the world and are often culturally prescribed remedies for a variety of maladies, and especially those related to mental health. What is the actual impact of these practices on health? Combining ethnographic observations and psychophysiological monitoring, we investigated outcomes of participation in one of the world’s most extreme rituals, involving bodily mutilation and prolonged suffering. Performance of this physically demanding ordeal had no detrimental effects on physiological health and was associated with subjective health improvements, and these improvements were greater for those who engaged in more intense forms of participation. Moreover, individuals who experienced health problems and/or were of low socioeconomic status sought more painful levels of engagement. We suggest two potential mechanisms for these effects: a bottom-up process triggered by neurological responses to pain and a top-down process related to increased social support and self-enhancement. These mechanisms may buffer stress-induced pressures and positively affect quality of life. Our results stress the importance of traditional cultural practices for coping with adversity, especially in contexts where psychiatric or other medical interventions are not widely available.

Mind wandering and stress: When you don't like the present moment.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Chronic psychological stress leads to increased mind wandering, less engagement, and more negative mood, while positive social connection enhances presence in the moment.

Abstract:Buddhist philosophy and existing empirical evidence suggest that being engaged in-and accepting-the present moment is associated with greater well-being. However, engaging with the present moment experience and ignoring unwanted thoughts is difficult given the nature of our minds and the competing demands for our attention. This may be especially true when experiencing psychological stress, during which acceptance of current experience may be particularly difficult. This study examines inter- and intraindividual variability in how psychological stress influences daily mind states, and how mind states are related to affect. For 21 days, women (n = 183; half chronically stressed, half low-stress controls) reported levels of mind wandering, engagement with and rejection of their current experience, positive and negative affect, and quality of connection to their partner. Women under chronic stress reported more evening mind wandering, less engagement, and more rejection of the moment, compared to low stress controls. These mind states were in turn associated with more negative evening mood. Daily contextual factors, specifically, having a stressful event (objectively coded) and quality of connection with spouse that day (a known stress buffer), influenced evening mind states. Results provide evidence that chronic and daily psychological stress interfere with daily presence while positive social connection enhances presence in the moment.

Music and Adolescent Mental Health: A Journey of Healing, Growth, and Self-Discovery

Number of 

Key takeaways:Listening to healing music for 30 minutes daily significantly improves teenagers' emotion regulation, psychological resilience, and self-cognition compared to quiet meditation.

Abstract:Music, as an emotional expression and adjustment tool, has a significant impact on the mental health of teenagers. Through a four-week experiment, this study explored the influence of music on teenagers' emotional state, psychological resilience, anxiety level, self-cognition and life satisfaction. The subjects were divided into experimental group and control group. The experimental group listened to healing music for 30 minutes every day, while the control group conducted quiet meditation activities. The mental health status of the two groups of teenagers was measured and compared by psychological scales such as PANAS, RS, STAI, self-concept and life satisfaction. The results show that the experimental group is significantly better than the control group in emotion regulation, psychological resilience improvement and self-cognition, which proves that music has the potential to promote the mental health of teenagers. This paper discusses the theoretical and practical significance of these findings.

Zooming into daily life: within-person associations between physical activity and affect in young adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:More physical activity in young adults leads to less negative and more positive evening affect, suggesting it as a promising health promotion strategy for physical and mental well-being.

Abstract:Objective: Negative affect in daily life is linked to poorer mental and physical health. Activity could serve as an effective, low-cost intervention to improve affect. However, few prior studies have assessed physical activity and affect in everyday life, limiting the ecological validity of prior findings. This study investigates whether daily activity is associated with negative and positive evening affect in young adults. Design: Young adults (N = 189, Mdn = 23.00) participated in an intensive longitudinal study over 10 consecutive days. Main Outcome Measures: Participants wore accelerometers to objectively assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity continuously throughout the day and reported their affect in time-stamped online evening diaries before going to sleep. Results: On days when participants engaged in more activity than usual, they reported not only less depressed and angry evening affect but also more vigour and serenity in the evening. Conclusion: Young adults showed both less negative and more positive affect on days with more activity. Physical activity is a promising health promotion strategy for physical and mental well-being.

Eveningness increases risks for depressive and anxiety symptoms and hospital treatments mediated by insufficient sleep in a population‐based study of 18,039 adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eveningness is associated with increased risks for depressive and anxiety symptoms and hospital treatments, mediated by insufficient sleep.

Abstract:Epidemiological data show that having the eveningness associates with poor mental health. For preventive measures it is important to know which underlying factors mediate these associations and the burden posed to public health. This study examines at a population‐based level, whether (1) circadian type and the sleep‐wake behavior‐based phase entrainment similarly associate with mental health problems, (2) there are differences in hospital treatments due to mental disorders between chronotypes, and (3) the association of chronotype with mental health is mediated by insufficient sleep.

Should You Switch Off or Stay Engaged? The Consequences of Thinking About Work on the Trajectory of Psychological Well-Being Over Time

Number of 

Key takeaways:Affective rumination during evenings can increase exhaustion over time, while problem-solving pondering does not significantly impact psychological well-being over time.

Abstract:This study examined how 2 different ways of being mentally engaged with work-related issues during evenings (affective rumination and problem-solving pondering) cause changes in psychological well-being over a 1-year period. We conducted a 3-wave longitudinal study with a time lag of 6 months between each wave. At the first measurement moment, participants filled out a survey over 5 consecutive working days assessing work-related affective rumination and problem-solving pondering during evenings. Exhaustion and health complaints were assessed at the first measurement moment as well as after 6 and 12 months. The 3 waves of data obtained from a total of 123 participants with full-time and primarily mentally demanding jobs were analyzed using latent growth curve modeling (LGM). The results showed that affective rumination is a significant predictor of increase in exhaustion over time. Problem-solving pondering was not found to be a significant predictor of change in psychological well-being over time. These findings demonstrate that work-related rumination during evenings may lead to health problems over time depending on the type of rumination. It suggests that unlike affective rumination, problem-solving pondering during evenings has no influence on psychological well-being over time.

Association between working evening shifts and mental health among Korean employees: data from the 5th Korean Working Conditions Survey

Number of 

Key takeaways:Working evening shifts negatively impacts employees' mental health, with higher levels of depression and anxiety observed in those working between one and nine shifts per month.

Abstract:Background Many studies have been conducted to investigate the harmful effect of shift work on physical and mental health. Although, by definition, “working evening shift” is included in the scope of shift work, most related studies conducted thus far have focused on working night shifts, overtime work, or different types of shift work, with little research effort dedicated to “working evening shifts.” Therefore, to fill this research gap, we investigated the effect of working evening shifts on workers’ mental health. Methods The participants of this study were 16,692 employees of the 50,205 that participated in the 5th wave of the Korean Working Conditions Survey. We performed χ2 test and logistic regression analysis to analyze the effects of independent variables on health problems and calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results In the logistic regression analysis adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, health-related factors, and work-related characteristics, employees who worked evening shifts showed higher levels of depression and anxiety compared to those that did not. In particular, the adjusted odds ratios of the group working evening shifts between one and nine times a month were the highest with 2.723 (95% CI: 2.014–3.682) for depression, 3.294 (95% CI: 2.547–4.259) for anxiety. Conclusions The results of our study suggest that working evening shifts has a negative effect on employees’ mental health. This trend decreased with an increase in the monthly frequency of evening work.

Quiet time: a nursing intervention to promote sleep in neurocritical care units.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Implementing a 'quiet time' protocol in neurocritical care units, reducing environmental stimuli, significantly increases the likelihood of patients sleeping during scheduled quiet time.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Patients in intensive care units are often sleep deprived, yet little research exists on the impact of nursing care on promoting sleep.

OBJECTIVES
To determine if implementing a 'quiet time' protocol to reduce external environmental stimuli is associated with increased frequency of sleep among patients in a neurocritical care unit.

METHODS
Patients were observed 8 times each day before and after implementation of a protocol in which environmental sounds and lights were decreased from 2 AM to 4 AM and from 2 PM to 4 PM. Data collected at 2:45 AM, 3:30 AM, 2:45 PM, and 3:30 PM on patients with scores of 10 or greater on the Glasgow Coma Scale were analyzed. A total of 2975 observations were made on a total of 239 patients: 1446 observations on 118 patients in the control group and 1529 observations on 121 patients in the intervention group.

RESULTS
The percentage of patients observed asleep was significantly higher during the months the quite-time period was implemented than during the control period before the intervention was started. The increase in sleep behavior was associated with decreased sound and light levels achieved during the quiet time. Patients observed during the intervention period were 1.6 times more likely to be asleep during the quiet time than were patients observed during the control period (P < .001).

CONCLUSIONS
A concentrated effort by staff to reduce environmental stimuli at discrete preset intervals increases the likelihood of sleep during scheduled quiet time in the neurocritical care unit.

Morningness/eveningness and the need for sleep

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eveningness is associated with a greater need for sleep, irregular sleep/wake habits, and increased caffeine consumption, but does not necessarily lead to more sleepy individuals.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to determine, in a large sample of adults of all ages (17–80 years), the effect of morningness/eveningness on sleep/wake schedules, sleep needs, sleep hygiene and subjective daytime somnolence. A total of 617 subjects (219 subjects per chronotype group) matched for age, sex and employment status, completed an abridged morningness/eveningness questionnaire, a questionnaire on sleep habits and the quality of sleep, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Eveningness was associated with a greater need for sleep, less time in bed during the week compared to ideal sleep needs, more time in bed at the weekend, a later bedtime and waking‐up time especially at the weekend, more irregular sleep/wake habits and greater caffeine consumption. These subjects built up a sleep debt during the week and extended their duration of sleep at the weekend. They did not, however, rate themselves more sleepy than other types, despite the fact that our results showed a clear link between subjectively evaluated daytime somnolence and sleep debt. Why they were less affected by sleep deprivation is not clear. This raises the question of individual susceptibility to the modification of sleep parameters.

0133 Stuck Song Syndrome: Bedtime Music Affects Nocturnal Polysomnography Outcomes

Number of 

Key takeaways:Listening to instrumental music before bedtime can worsen sleep quality, as it increases the likelihood of experiencing nocturnal 'earworms' and disrupting sleep onset.

Abstract:Nearly all adolescents and young adults listen to music everyday, with music listening near its highest level in the evening. The National Institutes of Health have recommended listening to quiet music as part of the bedtime routine, and some researchers have claimed that listening to music before bedtime improves sleep efficiency to the level of hypnotic medications. These recommendations are based solely on studies in which participants self-reported their sleep quality. Participants were 50 healthy young adults (M=21.2 years, 70% female). Following visual analogue ratings, participants were told to relax and listen to quiet music for 10 minutes. We standardized the music playlist to include three songs with high familiarity. The songs were played at a quiet volume (42 dB) while participants sat upright in bed with the lights dimmed (40 lux) to simulate a bedtime routine. Participants were randomly assigned to listen to the lyrical or instrumental-only versions of the songs. They then repeated visual analogue ratings prior to lights out. Experimenters were masked to conditions at all time points. Participants self-reported greater relaxation after listening to music in both conditions (ps<.05). In contrast to the popular notion that quiet instrumental music improves sleep quality, we observed significantly worse sleep efficiency in the instrumental condition than the lyrical condition, p<.05. Instrumental music impaired sleep quality because participants were nearly twice as likely to experience a nocturnal “earworm,” that is, a song stuck in their head. Nocturnal earworms were associated with longer sleep onset latency, lower sleep efficiency, greater time in N1, and less time in N3 (ps<.05). By contrast, polysomnography outcomes were unrelated to daytime earworms (i.e., earworms experienced the next morning). The perceived relaxing effects of music may reinforce bedtime listening behaviors, even when that music does not objectively improve sleep. In contrast to studies that measured sleep quality using self-report scales, the current work provides polysomnographic evidence that instrumental music can worsen sleep quality, particularly when instrumental music increases susceptibility to having a song stuck in one’s mind at night.

'Fully recharged' evenings? The effect of evening cyber leisure on next-day vitality and performance through sleep quantity and quality, bedtime procrastination, and psychological detachment, and the moderating role of mindfulness.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Evening cyber leisure negatively impacts sleep quantity and quality through bedtime procrastination, but positively impacts sleep quantity and quality through psychological detachment, with mindfulness enhancing these effects.

Abstract:Aligning with the recovery perspective, we propose a dual-path model to illustrate the effects of employees' evening cyber leisure on next-day work outcomes, namely, psychological vitality and performance. We argue that evening cyber leisure has contradicting effects on next-day performance and vitality through its effects on bedtime procrastination and psychological detachment, and in turn, sleep quantity and sleep quality. We also propose that trait mindfulness acts as an important boundary condition of the indirect effects of evening cyber leisure. We used an experience sampling methodology to collect 3 surveys per day for 10 days from 155 R&D employees of a biotech company. Our findings suggest that cyber leisure has a negative indirect effect on sleep quantity and sleep quality via bedtime procrastination, and a positive indirect effect on sleep quantity and sleep quality via evening psychological detachment. Additionally, sleep quantity was positively associated with performance, and sleep quality was positively associated with psychological vitality. Lastly, as trait mindfulness increased, the negative impact of cyber leisure on bedtime procrastination was mitigated, and the positive impact of cyber leisure on psychological detachment was enhanced. Theoretical and practical implications specific to the use of cyber devices for workplace recovery are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

080 Is Napping Only Beneficial to Evening Chronotypes? A Pilot Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Napping positively impacts emotional regulation, with greater benefits for those with the eveningness chronotype.

Abstract:Research shows associations between chronotype and behavior. While eveningness is associated with lower levels of self-control, morningness is associated with increased conscientiousness. Additionally, throughout the day, the increase in homeostatic sleep pressure due to wakefulness can affect executive functioning, including emotional regulation. Napping is an effective countermeasure to sleepiness and associated emotional dysregulation, but the impact of chronotype on this benefit is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of chronotype and a midday nap on an aspect of emotional regulation: frustration tolerance.
 
 
 
 40 participants between the ages of 18–50 were randomized into a 60-minute, midday nap or no-nap condition. Chronotype was measured using the Horne-Östberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Frustration tolerance (FT) was measured pre and post nap using an adaption of Feather’s frustration tolerance task where FT was measured as the time spent on an impossible task. To examine the association of chronotype and FT, correlational analysis was used. Chronotype was also determined using a median split of the MEQ due to few true morning and evening types in the sample. This data was then subjected to a repeated measures ANOVA with condition (pre or post-nap) as a within-subjects factor and group (nap or no-nap; high or low MEQ score) as between-subject factors.
 
 
 
 Results revealed a significant correlation between MEQ score and change in time spent on the impossible task, with those with lower MEQ scores (more evening) showing an increase in time spent on the impossible task, r(20) = -.51, p = .016. Similarly, results of the ANOVA revealed a significant condition (pre or post-nap) by group (nap, no nap; high, low MEQ) interaction, F(1,1) = 4.694, p = .039, such that, those in the nap group with lower MEQ (more evening) spent more time on the impossible task following the nap.
 
 
 
 Our results indicate that chronotype may impact a nap’s positive effect on emotional regulation, with greater benefit for those with the eveningness chronotype. Because napping is currently practiced by 1/3 of American adults, from a personalized medicine perspective, it’s imperative that its chronotype-dependent benefits be investigated further to effectively guide evidence-based recommendations.

Effects of Evening Exercise on Sleep in Healthy Participants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Evening exercise does not negatively affect sleep; in fact, it may improve sleep quality, but vigorous exercise within an hour of bedtime may impair sleep-onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency.

Abstract:BackgroundCurrent recommendations advise against exercising in the evening because of potential adverse effects on sleep.ObjectivesThe aim of this systematic review was to investigate the extent to which evening exercise affects sleep and whether variables such as exercise intensity or duration modify the response.MethodsA systematic search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Studies evaluating sleep after a single session of evening physical exercise compared to a no-exercise control in healthy adults were included. All analyses are based on random effect models.ResultsThe search yielded 11,717 references, of which 23 were included. Compared to control, evening exercise significantly increased rapid eye movement latency (+ 7.7 min; p = 0.032) and slow-wave sleep (+ 1.3 percentage points ; p = 0.041), while it decreased stage 1 sleep (− 0.9 pp; p = 0.001). Moderator analyses revealed that a higher temperature at bedtime was associated with lower sleep efficiency (SE) (b = − 11.6 pp; p = 0.020) and more wake after sleep onset (WASO; b = + 37.6 min; p = 0.0495). A higher level of physical stress (exercise intensity relative to baseline physical activity) was associated with lower SE (− 3.2 pp; p = 0.036) and more WASO (+ 21.9 min; p = 0.044). Compared to cycling, running was associated with less WASO (− 12.7 min; p = 0.037). All significant moderating effects disappeared after removal of one study.ConclusionOverall, the studies reviewed here do not support the hypothesis that evening exercise negatively affects sleep, in fact rather the opposite. However, sleep-onset latency, total sleep time, and SE might be impaired after vigorous exercise ending ≤ 1 h before bedtime.

The influence of evening activity on the onset of sleep.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Evening activities, such as exercise and relaxation, have similar effects on sleep onset, with mental stimulation playing a more important role than physiological activity.

Abstract:Sleep onset following three kinds of evening activities was investigated. These activities were six hours of strenuous physical work, six hours of intensive studying and mental work, and six hours of relaxation, i.e., watching TV, listening to records and reading magazines. Ss were 15 young men, each of whom participated in one activity per night for three non-consecutive nights. 
 
 
 
Results showed that studying delayed sleep onset by an average of about six minutes, but Ss took similar times to fall asleep after exercise and after relaxation. At the moment of sleep onset, heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and peripheral pulse volume all were significantly elevated after exercise, when compared to studying and relaxation. Both of these results combined were interpreted as indicating that the level of physiological, systemic activity is relatively unimportant for sleep onset, while the level of mental stimulation seems to play a more important role.

Double trouble? The effects of sleep deprivation and chronotype on adolescent affect.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sleep deprivation and an evening chronotype are associated with decreased positive affect and lower positivity ratios in adolescents, suggesting that improving sleep and reducing eveningness can reduce emotional vulnerability.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
  Two understudied risk factors that have been linked to emotional difficulties in adolescence are chronotype and sleep deprivation. This study extended past research by using an experimental design to investigate the role of sleep deprivation and chronotype on emotion in adolescents. It was hypothesized that sleep deprivation and an evening chronotype would be associated with decreased positive affect (PA), increased negative affect (NA), and lower positivity ratios.

METHODS
  Forty-seven healthy adolescents (aged 10-15 for girls, 11-16 for boys) participated in a sleep deprivation and a rested condition. A subsample of 24 adolescents was selected on the basis of extreme morningness or eveningness scores (based on outer quartiles of scores on the Children's Morningness-Eveningness Preferences Scale). PA and NA were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children, and positivity ratios were calculated by dividing PA by NA.

RESULTS
  Participants reported less positive affect and lower positivity ratios when sleep deprived, relative to when rested. Evening chronotypes reported less positive affect and lower positivity ratios than morning chronotypes in both rested and sleep deprivation conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
  These findings extend previous research by suggesting that adolescents are adversely impacted by sleep deprivation, and that an evening chronotype might serve as a useful marker of emotional vulnerability. Early intervention and prevention strategies can focus on improving sleep and on using chronotherapy principles to reduce eveningness.

The Whole Is Not the Sum of Its Parts: Specific Types of Positive Affect Influence Sleep Differentially

Number of 

Key takeaways:High trait vigor and state calm positively influence sleep efficiency and quality, while trait calm is generally unhelpful and negatively affects sleep duration.

Abstract:Given the known detrimental effects of poor sleep on an array of psychological and physical health processes, it is critical to understand the factors that protect sleep, especially during times of stress when sleep particularly suffers. Positive affect (PA) arises as a variable of interest given its known associations with health and health behaviors and its ability to buffer stress. In 2 studies, we examined which types of PA (distinguished by arousal level and trait/state measurement) were most beneficial for sleep and whether these associations varied depending on the stress context. In Study 1, college students (N = 99) reported on their PA and sleep during the week of a major exam. In Study 2, 2 weeks of daily PA and sleep data were collected during a period with no examinations in a similar sample of students (N = 83). Results indicated that high trait vigor was tied to better sleep efficiency and quality, especially during high stress. Trait calm was generally unhelpful to sleep, and was related negatively to sleep duration. State calm, on the other hand, interacted with stress in Study 2 to predict more efficient day-to-day sleep on days with higher average stress. These findings illustrate the importance of considering arousal level, affect duration, and the stress context in studies of PA and health.

Sleep and quiet wakefulness signify an idling brain hub for creative insights

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sleep and quiet wakefulness are key to forming novel connections in the brain, leading to new information and creative insights, impacting our ability to process information, make decisions, and navigate complex situations.

Abstract:Long-term potentiation of synaptic strength is a fundamental aspect of learning and memory. Memories are believed to be stored within specific populations of neurons known as engram cells, which are subsequently reactivated during sleep, facilitating the consolidation of stored information. However, sleep and offline reactivations are associated not only with past experiences but also with anticipation of future events. During periods of offline reactivation, which occur during sleep and quiet wakefulness, the brain exhibits a capability to form novel connections. This process links various past experiences, often leading to the emergence of qualitatively new information that was not initially available. Brain activity during sleep and quiet wakefulness is referred to as the ‘idling brain’. Idling brain activity is believed to play a pivotal role in abstracting essential information, comprehending underlying rules, generating creative ideas and fostering insightful thoughts. In this review, we will explore the current state of research and future directions in understanding how sleep and idling brain activity are interconnected with various cognitive functions, especially creative insights. These insights have profound implications for our daily lives, impacting our ability to process information, make decisions and navigate complex situations effectively. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Long-term potentiation: 50 years on’.

The daily reciprocal associations between electroencephalography measured sleep and affect

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher negative affect in the evening is associated with more fragmented REM sleep, but no significant reciprocal association was found between negative and positive affect and EEG measured sleep.

Abstract:Self‐report studies show that sleep and positive and negative affect are closely and bidirectionally linked. However, studies assessing sleep objectively yield more inconsistent results. This study assessed the reciprocal, daily relationship between sleep as measured with electroencephalography (EEG) and affect (measured in the evening) in a natural setting. We assessed sleep both on the macrolevel (i.e., rapid eye movement sleep and slow‐wave sleep duration) and on the microlevel (i.e., REM sleep fragmentation). In this study, 33 participants (i.e., healthy college students, mean age 21.55  years, 67% female) were followed for 2 weeks. Each participant wore an EEG headband for 15 nights and had polysomnography during 3 of the 15 nights providing 72 analysable nights of polysomnography and 271 analysable nights with the EEG headband. Every evening participants reported their momentary negative and positive affect. We examined the relationship between pre‐sleep affect and the sleep variables, as well as the reverse relationship, with sleep variables predicting evening affect the next day. We detected that higher negative affect in the evening was related to more fragmented REM sleep. However, this result was only found with polysomnography and not with the EEG headband. No significant associations were found between affect and time spent in REM sleep and SWS. Overall, no support was found for the reciprocal association between negative and positive affect and EEG measured sleep. Only limited support was found for an association in one direction (i.e., evening negative affect was associated with more REM sleep fragmentation at night).

Relaxation during the evening and next-morning energy: The role of hassles, uplifts, and heart rate variability during work.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Goal-frustration events and heart rate variability both contribute to evening relaxation, which indirectly impacts next-morning energy, providing insights into how mind and body impact off-the-job recovery.

Abstract:Being able to psychologically relax after work in the evening is important to the day-to-day recovery process and should enable employees to wake up feeling energized for the next workday. Drawing on affective events theory and allostatic load theory, we expected that employees will be able to psychologically relax when they get home from work if during work (a) they experienced less work-related goal-frustration events and more work-related goal-achievement events and (b) if they were adaptively regulating physiological stress arousal (as indexed by heart rate variability). As such, this research considers that work events, as well as a physiological indicator of parasympathetic regulation, can be important antecedents to off-the-job recovery. Over the course of 5 consecutive workdays, 72 employees completed daily surveys (on waking, at work, and in the evening) and wore an ambulatory electrocardiograph to measure their heart rate variability while at work that afternoon. Multilevel mediation analyses revealed support for our hypotheses at the within-person level, except for the role of goal-attainment events. The finding that goal-frustration events and heart rate variability both contribute to evening relaxation, and then indirectly to next-morning energy, provides initial insights on how both mind and body impact off-the-job recovery.

Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM) Therapy for Improving the Quality of Life of Patients With Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.

Number of 

Key takeaways:CALM therapy may improve quality of life, spiritual well-being, sleep quality, and relieve anxiety, depression, and fatigue in cancer patients.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Cancer patients, at both early and advanced stages, face complex bio-psycho-social-spiritual problems impacting their quality of life (QoL). Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM) therapy is a psychotherapeutic approach that helps cancer patients find hope and meaning in life, thereby improving QoL.

AIM
This study aimed to critically assess the effects of CALM therapy on the QoL in cancer patients.

DESIGN
This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

METHODS
The main outcome was QoL, and the secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression, spiritual well-being, fatigue and sleep quality. Five English databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library and ProQuest) and one trial registry site (Clinicaltrial.gov) were searched from their inception until March 2024. The pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models and expressed as standard mean difference (SMD) or weighted mean difference (WMD). Review Manager 5.4 was used for data analysis. A sensitivity analysis was done by excluding one trial at a time to check the consistency of the results on QoL. The study protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023398655).

RESULTS
Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and twelve for the meta-analysis, with a total of 1635 cancer patients. CALM therapy showed significant benefits on QoL (SMD = 1.97), spiritual well-being (WMD = 1.93) and sleep quality (SMD = -1.56) compared with usual care. It also reduced anxiety (SMD = -1.94), depression (SMD = -1.28) and fatigue (SMD = -5.86) significantly. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of these results when each trial was removed one by one.

CONCLUSION
CALM therapy may improve QoL, spiritual well-being, sleep quality and relieve anxiety, depression and fatigue in cancer patients.

RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
This therapy should be promoted clinically as a comprehensive psychotherapeutic approach in cancer care.

Testing a mindfulness meditation mobile app for the treatment of sleep-related symptoms in adults with sleep disturbance: A randomized controlled trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:The Calm app effectively reduces fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal in adults with sleep disturbance, improving sleep quality.

Abstract:The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to test whether a commercially available, mindfulness meditation mobile app, (i.e., Calm app), was effective in reducing fatigue (primary outcome), pre-sleep arousal, and daytime sleepiness (secondary outcomes) in adults with sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index Score >10) as compared to a wait-list control group. Associations between the use of the Calm app (i.e., adherence to the intervention) and changes in sleep quality was also explored in the intervention group only. Adults with sleep disturbance were recruited (N = 640). Eligible and consenting participants (N = 263) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 124) or a wait-list control (n = 139) group. Intervention participants were asked to meditate using the Calm app ≥10 minutes/day for eight weeks. Fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal were assessed at baseline, mid- (4-weeks) and post-intervention (8-weeks) in both groups, whereas sleep quality was evaluated only in the intervention group. Findings from intent-to-treat analyses suggest the use of the Calm app for eight weeks significantly decreased daytime fatigue (p = .018) as well as daytime sleepiness (p = .003) and cognitive (p = .005) and somatic (p < .001) pre-sleep arousal as compared to the wait-list control group. Within the intervention group, use of the Calm app was associated with improvements in sleep quality (p < .001). This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that the Calm app can be used to treat fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal in adults with sleep disturbance. Given that the Calm app is affordable and widely accessible, these data have implications for community level dissemination of a mobile app to improve sleep-related symptoms associated with sleep disturbance.

Key takeaways:CALM therapy significantly improves psychological distress, anxiety, depression, cancer-related fatigue, sleep disturbance, and quality of life for cancer patients, but its effects on alleviating fear of cancer recurrence remain limited.

Abstract:ABSTRACT Background Managing cancer and living meaningfully (CALM) therapy is a psychosocial intervention designed to enhance the well‐being of cancer patients; however, its impact on health‐related outcomes in cancer patients remains unclear. Aims This study aimed to systematically synthesize current evidence to assess the impact of CALM therapy on health‐related health outcomes and identify key features for optimizing the intervention. Methods An exhaustive search was conducted across seven databases from inception to July 5, 2024. Two reviewers separately evaluated the eligibility of studies, performed data extraction, and examined the methodological quality using the Cochrane's risk of bias tool. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE, and data analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.4. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024568561). Results Eleven studies (n = 1284) were included. CALM therapy showed significant improvements in psychological distress (MD = −2.43, 95% CI , p = 0.002), anxiety (SMD = −1.06, 95% CI , p = 0.004), depression (SMD = −0.65, 95% CI , p = 0.008), quality of life (SMD = 1.44, 95% CI , p = 0.003), cancer‐related fatigue (SMD = −3.54, 95% CI , p = 0.003), and sleep disturbance (SMD = −1.00, 95% CI , p = 0.02). However, its effects on alleviating the fear of cancer recurrence were not statistically significant. Linking Evidence to Action CALM therapy has demonstrated positive effects on psychological distress, anxiety, depression, cancer‐related fatigue, sleep disturbance, and quality of life. However, evidence regarding its effects on the fear of cancer recurrence remains limited. While we explored potential sources of heterogeneity, no primary cause was identified. Our findings remained largely consistent after this exploration, but due to the observed heterogeneity, these results should still be interpreted with caution. Further high‐quality randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings and assess the long‐term implications of CALM therapy.

Effects of the CALM intervention on cancer-related fatigue and heart rate variability in NSCLC: a randomized trial.

Number of 

Key takeaways:The CALM intervention positively impacts overall physical and mental health, fatigue reduction, quality of life, and heart rate variability in non-small cell lung cancer patients.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the effects of CALM intervention on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), and heart rate variability (HRV) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

METHODS
A total of 153 NSCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to the CALM group and usual care (UC) group. Patients in the CALM group were received 6 CALM intervention sessions over a 12-week period and evaluated using CRF, QOL and HRV at baseline (T0) and after 2, 4, and 6 intervention sessions.

RESULTS
The CALM group showed significant differences in total CRF, behavioral/daily life CRF, emotional/affective CRF, sensory/physical CRF, cognitive CRF and QOL before and after CALM intervention sessions (F = 643.47, F = 208.34, F = 354.52, F = 285.69, F = 334.29, F = 245.77, p < 0.001). The CALM group showed significant increases in standard deviation of normal R-R interval (SDNN) and high-frequency power (HF) (z = -4.94, p < 0.001,z = -4.30, p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were observed between CRF and SDNN, HF and QOL across all participants.

CONCLUSIONS
The CALM intervention had a positive impact on overall physical and mental health, fatigue reduction, quality of life and autonomic dysfunction in NSCLC patients. Heart rate variability may serve as an observational indicator of physical and mental health.

Effects of mindfulness and fatigue on emotional processing: an event-related potentials study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Mindfulness meditation can help maintain emotional responsiveness in fatigued individuals by maintaining late positive potential amplitudes.

Abstract:Fatigue is a common experience in everyday life. People who experience fatigue will have more intense negative emotions, and at the same time, their positive emotions will decrease, impairing the individual’s emotional processing ability. In previous research, mindfulness meditation reduces the intensity of negative emotional stimuli. However, if individuals continue to be affected by negative emotions when they are fatigued, it is unclear whether mindfulness can buffer the negative association between fatigue and emotions. This study examined whether mindfulness meditation affects the association between fatigue and emotions, using event-related potentials (ERPs). One hundred and forty-five participants completed the experiment. They were randomly assigned to the Mindfulness or Non-mindfulness group; and they were presented with positive, neutral, or negative pictures in an emotional processing task before and after mindfulness or rest. Late positive potential (LPP) is an important indicator of emotional stimuli perceived by individuals, and positive or negative pictures can induce an increase in LPP amplitude more than neutral pictures. Our findings suggest that fatigue significantly affected individuals’ LPP amplitudes in the early, mid, and late windows in the Non-mindfulness group, specifically, the more fatigued individuals had lower LPP amplitudes, but not in the Mindfulness group. These results suggest that in a state of fatigue, mindful individuals are able to maintain responsiveness to emotional stimuli by maintaining LPP amplitude. Our study has demonstrated that mindfulness meditation, to some extent, offsets the negative association of fatigue with the neural activation of emotions.

Progressive muscle relaxation aims to relax the muscles in the body and includes breathing techniques. Methods This study was carried out between January 2022 and July 2022 with 63 postmenopausal women who applied to a district state hospital and had poor sleep quality. The women assigned to the experimental group (EG) (n = 31) applied progressive muscle relaxation exercises every day for 8 weeks. In contrast, the women in the control group (CG) (n = 32) continued their routine coping habits related to sleep problems and fatigue in the postmenopausal period. The EG and CG were reevaluated using the Piper Fatigue Scale and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index in the fourth and eighth weeks. The women applied progressive muscle relaxation exercises with a guide prepared by the researchers and the compact disc of the Turkish Psychologists Association. In the data analysis, the independent-samples t test, Fisher's exact test, and χ2 test were used to compare individual, obstetric, and medical characteristics between the groups. The difference between dependent groups at different times was evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results There was an improvement in fatigue symptoms in the progressive muscle relaxation exercises-performing EG at the end of 8 weeks compared with the CG, and fatigue symptoms increased in the CG (P < 0.001). There was a greater improvement in the sleep quality of the progressive muscle relaxation exercises-performing EG at the end of 8 weeks compared with the CG (P < 0.001). Conclusions In our study, it was determined that progressive muscle relaxation exercises had an improving effect on sleep quality and fatigue.

Key takeaways:CALM alleviated cancer-related fatigue and improved quality of life and sleep quality in gastrointestinal cancer patients, with changes in IL-4, IL-6, and TNF- levels.

Abstract:Objective: To evaluate the effects of managing cancer and living meaningfully (CALM), a psychological intervention with semi-structured interviews, on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), and sleep quality in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, which may be accompanied by changes in cytokine levels. Methods: A total of 152 GI cancer patients with CRF were enrolled in the study during treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to CALM or usual care (UC) groups. Patients in the CALM group received 12 weeks of CALM plus usual care, and patients in the UC group received usual care plus usual health education. All study participants were evaluated at baseline and at 12 weeks using the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, while cytokine levels were measured. Results: At 12 weeks, the differences in total CRF, QOL, sleep quality, IL-6, IL-4, and TNF-α levels were statistically significant not only in the CALM group compared to patients in the UC group (t = −7.902, t = 2.163, t = −2.187, t = 3.313, t = −4.120, t = −3.853, respectively; P < .05), but also in the CALM group compared to baseline (t = 11.331, t = −5.492, t = 5.450, t = −2.418, t = 2.186, t = 2.699, respectively; P < .05). Additionally, the total CRF at 12 weeks was correlated with IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α levels (r = −.30, r = .31, r = .32, respectively; P < .001). Conclusions: CALM alleviated CRF and improved QOL and sleep quality in patients with GI cancer, and these improvements were accompanied by changes in IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α levels.

The Effect of Meditation-Based Interventions on Patients with Fatigue Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Meditation-based interventions (MeBIs) effectively reduce pathological fatigue symptoms in patients, with a greater impact in studies using passive control groups compared to active control groups.

Abstract:Persistent fatigue constitutes a prevalent and debilitating symptom in several diseases. The symptom is not effectively alleviated by pharmaceutical treatments, and meditation has been proposed as a non-pharmacological intervention. Indeed, meditation has been shown to reduce inflammatory/immune problems, pain, stress, anxiety and depression which are associated with pathological fatigue. This review synthesizes data from randomized control trials (RCTs) that explored the effect of meditation-based interventions (MeBIs) on fatigue in pathological conditions. Eight databases were searched from inception to April 2020. Thirty-four RCTs met eligibility criteria and covered six conditions (68% cancer), 32 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The main analysis showed an effect in favor of MeBIs compared to control groups (g = 0.62). Separate moderator analyses assessing control group, pathological condition, and MeBI type, highlighted a significantly moderating role of the control group. Indeed, compared to actively controlled studies, studies using a passive control group were associated with a statistically significantly more beneficial impact of the MeBIs (g = 0.83). These results indicate that MeBIs alleviate pathological fatigue and it seems that the studies with a passive control group showed a greater effect of MeBI on the reduction of fatigue compared to studies using active control groups. However, the specific effect of meditation type and pathological condition should be analyzed with more studies, and there remains a need to assess meditation effects on different types of fatigue (i.e., physical and mental) and in additional conditions (e.g., post-COVID-19).

Key takeaways:CALM is an effective psychotherapeutic intervention that effectively reduces cancer-related fatigue and improves quality of life in Chinese gastrointestinal cancer survivors.

Abstract:This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of CALM (managing cancer and living meaningfully), which is a psychotherapeutic intervention used to reduce cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and improve quality of life (QOL) in Chinese gastrointestinal cancer survivors (GCs). A total of 115 GCs were enrolled in this study. All patients were randomly assigned to either the CALM group or the usual care (UC) group. All patients were evaluated using the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS) and Quality of Life Assessment Scale before and after 2, 4, and 6 CALM or UC sessions with GCs presenting with severe fatigue. We compared the differences in these scores between the CALM group and the UC group and analyzed the correlations between CRF and QOL scores. Compared with the UC group, the CALM group showed significant differences in total CRF, behavioral/daily life CRF, emotional/affective CRF, sensory/physical CRF, cognitive CRF and QOL scores before and after 2, 4, and 6 CALM sessions (F=3106.434, F=1113.831, F=1159.919, F=1502.266, F=820.275, F=606.513, respectively; P<0.001). Finally, negative correlations were found between CRF and QOL scores in the GCs in the CALM group (before treatment: r=-0.46, P=0.0002; after 2 sessions: r=-0.46, P=0.0002; after 4 sessions: r=-0.51, P<0.0001; after 6 sessions: r =-0.44, P=0.0004). The CALM intervention effectively reduced fatigue in cancer patients and improved their QOL. This study suggests that CALM as a psychotherapeutic intervention may be an effective way to reduce CRF.

Key takeaways:Daily meditation delivered via Calm may improve sleep disturbance, inflammatory markers, fatigue, and emotional distress in patients with chronic hematological cancer.

Abstract:Background To address the need for long-term, accessible, nonpharmacologic interventions targeting sleep in patients with chronic hematological cancer, we propose the first randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of a consumer-based mobile meditation app, Calm, on sleep disturbance in this population. Objective This study aims to test the efficacy of daily meditation delivered via Calm compared with a health education podcast control group in improving the primary outcome of self-reported sleep disturbance, as well as secondary sleep outcomes, including sleep impairment and sleep efficiency; test the efficacy of daily meditation delivered via Calm compared with a health education podcast control group on inflammatory markers, fatigue, and emotional distress; and explore free-living use during a 12-week follow-up period and the sustained effects of Calm in patients with chronic hematological cancer. Methods In a double-blinded randomized controlled trial, we will recruit 276 patients with chronic hematological cancer to an 8-week app-based wellness intervention—the active, daily, app-based meditation intervention or the health education podcast app control group, followed by a 12-week follow-up period. Participants will be asked to use their assigned app for at least 10 minutes per day during the 8-week intervention period; complete web-based surveys assessing self-reported sleep disturbance, fatigue, and emotional distress at baseline, 8 weeks, and 20 weeks; complete sleep diaries and wear an actigraphy device during the 8-week intervention period and at 20 weeks; and complete blood draws to assess inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and C-reactive protein) at baseline, 8 weeks, and 20 weeks. Results This project was funded by the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute (R01CA262041). The projects began in April 2022, and study recruitment is scheduled to begin in October 2022, with a total project duration of 5 years. We anticipate that we will be able to achieve our enrollment goal of 276 patients with chronic hematological cancers within the allotted project time frame. Conclusions This research will contribute to broader public health efforts by providing researchers and clinicians with an evidence-based commercial product to improve sleep in the long term in an underserved and understudied cancer population with a high incidence of sleep disturbance.
