Macronutrient individualization and its effect on metabolism and body weight

Optimizing macronutrient distribution in the diet—particularly by increasing protein and fiber intake and limiting saturated fats and simple sugars—contributes to improved metabolic parameters, body weight, and glycemic control. Effects depend on individual needs, health goals, and lifestyle, but benefits have been observed in both healthy individuals and those with metabolic disorders.

Level of evidence:Good

Level of risk:Negligible

Proper selection of protein, fat, and carbohydrate ratios helps optimize energy expenditure, improve insulin sensitivity, and support fat loss while preserving muscle mass. Increasing dietary protein and fiber boosts the thermogenic effect of food and satiety, while reducing saturated fats and simple sugars supports metabolic health. Macronutrient individualization enables better alignment of the diet with age, activity level, health status, and therapeutic goals.

Level of risk:Negligible

Optimizing macronutrient distribution according to current guidelines is safe for most people and rarely causes adverse effects. Risks mainly relate to very atypical or extreme proportions or long-term use without specialist supervision.

Macronutrient optimization is not recommended for individuals with certain conditions requiring specialized diets or medical supervision of diet composition.

Recommended proportions: protein 15–25% of energy, fat 25–35%, carbohydrates 45–60% (according to guidelines from the National Food and Nutrition Institute, WHO, EFSA).

Natural products: lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, vegetable oils.

First metabolic effects visible after 2–4 weeks; optimization of body weight and metabolic parameters – after 2–3 months.

There are no strict recommendations, although protein is beneficial when consumed evenly throughout the day; carbohydrates – around workout times or with breakfast/lunch.

Monitor not only body weight but also waist circumference, well-being, satiety, and energy levels. Regular basic lab tests are recommended.

Gradual implementation of changes

Introduce macronutrient ratio changes slowly (e.g., over 1–2 weeks) to allow your body to adapt and avoid digestive issues.

Focus on quality, not just proportions

Choose high-quality, minimally processed foods; avoid trans fats, simple sugars, and excess saturated fats.

Diet under specialist supervision

With chronic conditions, during pregnancy, or in children, make changes only under the guidance of a clinical dietitian.

Adjust macronutrient ratios to your goal (fat loss, muscle gain, health), activity level, and any comorbidities. Test different versions and observe which works best for you.

Optimizing macronutrient distribution in the diet can positively affect metabolism, especially in terms of weight control, metabolic syndrome parameters, and energy expenditure. The greatest benefits are seen when protein, fat, and carbohydrate ratios are tailored to individual needs and health goals.

Final comment:The impact of macronutrient distribution on human metabolic health has been well documented in numerous clinical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. These analyses indicate that individualizing the proportions of protein, fats, and carbohydrates can lead to improvements in metabolic syndrome parameters, weight reduction, lipid profile, and glycemic control. Most studies focus on the general population as well as individuals with obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. The results are consistent, although the strength of the effect may depend on individual predispositions, gender, and lifestyle. In summary, the current state of knowledge justifies assigning this intervention a 'good' level – its effectiveness has been confirmed in human studies, though effects may vary depending on individual characteristics and the specifics of the dietary scheme used.

Macronutrient Caloric Distribution Affects Metabolic Syndrome Parameters Among College Students (P08-049-19)

Number of 

Key takeaways:Meeting macronutrient distribution ranges and adequate fiber intake positively affect Metabolic Syndrome parameters in college students, with the exception of HDL-C.

Abstract:We analyzed macronutrient distribution and its effects on Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) among Weber State students. We hypothesized that MetS parameters will be positively affected by meeting the acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDRs) for carbohydrate, protein, and fat.
 
 
 
 MetS data and two-day diet records were analyzed from 385 Weber State students (ages 18 to 65). Participants were separated by gender (Male: 128; Female: 257), and by macronutrient distribution. Groups indicated those who met all AMDRs for carbohydrate, protein, and fat, and those who did not. We also categorized participants as deficient (below 67% DRI) or sufficient in fiber intake (above/equal to 100% DRI). The mean differences on MetS parameters were evaluated by independent samples t-test.
 
 
 
 Females who met all the AMDR's, had significantly lower body weight (BW) (μ1 = 64.8 vs μ2 = 69.9 Kg; P = 0.042), waist circumference (WC) (μ1 = 77 vs μ2 = 81.2 cm; P = 0.028), HDL-C (μ1 = 51.2 vs μ2 = 56.3 mg/dL; P = 0.032), and blood glucose levels (μ1 = 87.4 vs μ2 = 90.2 mg/dL; P = 0.029) than those who failed to meet these recommendations. Participants consuming adequate fiber had lower BW (μ1 = 75.3 vs μ2 = 67.3 Kg; P = 0.005), lower WC (μ1 = 83.3 vs μ2 = 77.8 cm; P = 0.009), and higher HDL-C (μ1 = 48.5 vs μ2 = 55.4 mg/dL; P = 0.021) (P < 0.05) when compared with their deficient counterparts.
 
 
 
 Meeting AMDRs showed no effect on MetS factors among males. In females, meeting AMDRs had positive effects on most MetS parameters with exception of HDL-C. Although HDL-C was decreased, total cholesterol was also reduced. Thus, leading to an unaffected HDL/Total-cholesterol-ratio, a more reliable predictor of cardiovascular disease. Adequate fiber intake beneficially affected central adiposity and HDL-C levels.

Obesity and the metabolic syndrome: role of different dietary macronutrient distribution patterns and specific nutritional components on weight loss and maintenance.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Changing dietary macronutrient distribution and composition can lead to weight loss, longer-term body weight maintenance, better appetite regulation, and changes in metabolic syndrome features.

Abstract:Weight loss and subsequent body weight maintenance are difficult for obese individuals despite the wide variety of dietary regimens and approaches. A substantial body of scientific evidence has shown that by simply varying the macronutrient distribution and composition of dietary factors, weight losses of varying amounts, longer-term body weight maintenance periods, better appetite regulation, and changes in features of the metabolic syndrome can be achieved. At present, renewed efforts are underway to increase the protein content of weight-loss diets, simultaneously restrict fat consumption to no more than 30%, favor polyunsaturated fat, have carbohydrates account for between 40 and 50% of total energy intake, and promote the consumption of low-glycemic foods. The present article reviews the scientific evidence for the effects of several dietary manipulations and sustainable strategies for weight loss and body weight stability as well as for treating specific features of the metabolic syndrome.

Effect of macronutrient intake during the second trimester on glucose metabolism later in pregnancy.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher saturated and trans fat intake during the second trimester is associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes, while lower carbohydrate and higher total fat intake increases the risk.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Dietary intake is known to influence glucose metabolism, but there is little consensus on the optimal distribution of macronutrient intakes during pregnancy to prevent gestational diabetes (GDM).

OBJECTIVE
We aimed to investigate whether macronutrient intake distribution during the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with glucose metabolism later in pregnancy.

DESIGN
Women with singleton pregnancies and without preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes were included. Participants underwent a 3-h oral-glucose-tolerance test at 30 wk (95% CI: 25, 33 wk) gestation and were asked to recall their second-trimester dietary intake by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire.

RESULTS
Of the 205 participants, 47 (22.9%) had a diagnosis of GDM. A higher intake of saturated fat (β ± SEE: 0.059 ± 0.021; P = 0.005) and trans fat (0.381 ± 0.145; P = 0.009) as a percentage of energy and of added sugar (0.017 ± 0.007; P = 0.02) and a lower intake of vegetable and fruit fiber (-0.026 ± 0.012; P = 0.03) were individually associated with increased fasting glucose after multiple adjustment. In participants with a family history of type 2 diabetes, a higher vegetable and fruit fiber intake was associated with reduced insulin resistance (-0.100 ± 0.029; P = 0.0008) and increased insulin sensitivity (0.029 ± 0.012; P = 0.01), after similar adjustment. An increased risk (OR per 1-SD change) of GDM was associated with lower carbohydrate (0.60; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.90) and higher total fat (1.61; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.44) intakes as a percentage of energy, after similar adjustment.

CONCLUSIONS
Macronutrient intake during the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with a risk of abnormal glucose metabolism later in pregnancy. This finding supports the need for continued work to determine optimal prenatal nutritional strategies to prevent GDM. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01405547.

Changes in weight loss, body composition and cardiovascular disease risk after altering macronutrient distributions during a regular exercise program in obese women

Number of 

Key takeaways:Regular exercise and modest caloric restriction promote weight loss, body composition improvements, and muscular fitness in obese women.

Abstract:This study's purpose investigated the impact of different macronutrient distributions and varying caloric intakes along with regular exercise for metabolic and physiological changes related to weight loss.One hundred forty-one sedentary, obese women (38.7 ± 8.0 yrs, 163.3 ± 6.9 cm, 93.2 ± 16.5 kg, 35.0 ± 6.2 kg•m(-2), 44.8 ± 4.2% fat) were randomized to either no diet + no exercise control group (CON) a no diet + exercise control (ND), or one of four diet + exercise groups (high-energy diet , very low carbohydrate, high protein diet , low carbohydrate, moderate protein diet and high carbohydrate, low protein ) in addition to beginning a 3x•week(-1) supervised resistance training program. After 0, 1, 10 and 14 weeks, all participants completed testing sessions which included anthropometric, body composition, energy expenditure, fasting blood samples, aerobic and muscular fitness assessments. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with an alpha of 0.05 with LSD post-hoc analysis when appropriate.All dieting groups exhibited adequate compliance to their prescribed diet regimen as energy and macronutrient amounts and distributions were close to prescribed amounts. Those groups that followed a diet and exercise program reported significantly greater anthropometric (waist circumference and body mass) and body composition via DXA (fat mass and % fat) changes. Caloric restriction initially reduced energy expenditure, but successfully returned to baseline values after 10 weeks of dieting and exercising. Significant fitness improvements (aerobic capacity and maximal strength) occurred in all exercising groups. No significant changes occurred in lipid panel constituents, but serum insulin and HOMA-IR values decreased in the VLCHP group. Significant reductions in serum leptin occurred in all caloric restriction + exercise groups after 14 weeks, which were unchanged in other non-diet/non-exercise groups.Overall and over the entire test period, all diet groups which restricted their caloric intake and exercised experienced similar responses to each other. Regular exercise and modest caloric restriction successfully promoted anthropometric and body composition improvements along with various markers of muscular fitness. Significant increases in relative energy expenditure and reductions in circulating leptin were found in response to all exercise and diet groups. Macronutrient distribution may impact circulating levels of insulin and overall ability to improve strength levels in obese women who follow regular exercise.

The effects of dietary macronutrient composition on resting energy expenditure following active weight loss: A systematic review and meta‐analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Dietary macronutrient composition affects resting energy expenditure differently depending on the degree of weight loss and individual metabolic responses.

Abstract:A systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted to evaluate the relative effectiveness of different dietary macronutrient patterns on changes in resting energy expenditure (REE) in relation to weight loss, categorized as minimal (<5%) and moderate to high (>5%). Changes in REE were assessed using a DerSimonian and Laird random‐effects meta‐analysis. A diet lower in carbohydrates (CHO) or higher in fat and protein was associated with smaller reductions in REE, with these trends being more pronounced among participants who experienced moderate to high weight loss. Adjusted meta‐regression analysis indicated that, within the participants who experienced moderate to high weight loss, each 1% increase in CHO intake was associated with a reduction of 2.30 kcal/day in REE (95% CI: −4.11 to −0.47, p = 0.013). In contrast, a 1% increase in protein and fat intake was correlated with an increase in REE by 3.00 (95% confidence interval , p = 0.003) and 0.5 (95% CI , p = 0.740) kcal/day, respectively. No significant associations were found among participants who experienced minimal weight loss. These findings indicate that, under a caloric deficit, the impact of dietary macronutrient composition on REE may vary depending on the degree of weight loss and individual metabolic responses.

'Nutraceuticals' in relation to human skeletal muscle and exercise.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Nutraceuticals, such as leucine, hydroxyl -methylbutyrate, creatine, vitamin-D, ursolic acid, and phosphatidic acid, may enhance muscle mass, protein metabolism, and exercise performance.

Abstract:Skeletal muscles have a fundamental role in locomotion and whole body metabolism, with muscle mass and quality being linked to improved health and even lifespan. Optimizing nutrition in combination with exercise is considered an established, effective ergogenic practice for athletic performance. Importantly, exercise and nutritional approaches also remain arguably the most effective countermeasure for muscle dysfunction associated with aging and numerous clinical conditions, e.g., cancer cachexia, COPD, and organ failure, via engendering favorable adaptations such as increased muscle mass and oxidative capacity. Therefore, it is important to consider the effects of established and novel effectors of muscle mass, function, and metabolism in relation to nutrition and exercise. To address this gap, in this review, we detail existing evidence surrounding the efficacy of a nonexhaustive list of macronutrient, micronutrient, and 'nutraceutical' compounds alone and in combination with exercise in relation to skeletal muscle mass, metabolism (protein and fuel), and exercise performance (i.e., strength and endurance capacity). It has long been established that macronutrients have specific roles and impact upon protein metabolism and exercise performance, (i.e., protein positively influences muscle mass and protein metabolism), whereas carbohydrate and fat intakes can influence fuel metabolism and exercise performance. Regarding novel nutraceuticals, we show that the following ones in particular may have effects in relation to 1) muscle mass/protein metabolism: leucine, hydroxyl β-methylbutyrate, creatine, vitamin-D, ursolic acid, and phosphatidic acid; and 2) exercise performance: (i.e., strength or endurance capacity): hydroxyl β-methylbutyrate, carnitine, creatine, nitrates, and β-alanine.

Postprandial Metabolomic Profiling: Insights into Macronutrient-Specific Metabolic Responses in Healthy Individuals

Number of 

Key takeaways:Distinct metabolic responses to macronutrient intake in healthy individuals, with specific metabolites playing a role in regulating postprandial metabolism and influencing metabolic health and insulin sensitivity.

Abstract:Background/Objectives: Understanding the metabolic responses to different macronutrients is crucial for assessing their impacts on health. This study aims to investigate the postprandial metabolomic profiles of healthy individuals following the consumption of glucose, protein, and lipids. Methods: Twenty-three healthy, normal-weight adults participated in the study, randomly assigned to consume 300 kcal from glucose, protein, or lipids after an overnight fast. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 h post-ingestion. An untargeted metabolomic approach using mass spectrometry was employed to analyze plasma metabolites. Results: In total, 21, 59, and 156 dysregulated metabolites were identified after glucose, protein, and lipid intake, respectively. Notably, 3’-O-methylguanosine levels decreased significantly after glucose consumption while remaining stable during lipid intake before increasing at 2 h. Common metabolites shared between glucose and lipid groups included 3’-O-methylguanosine, 3-oxotetradecanoic acid, poly-g-D-glutamate, and triglyceride (TG) (15:0/18:4/18:1). Conclusions: The findings highlight distinct metabolic responses to macronutrient intake, emphasizing the role of specific metabolites in regulating postprandial metabolism. These insights contribute to understanding how dietary components influence metabolic health and insulin sensitivity.

Short-Term Effects of Weight-Loss Meal Replacement Programs with Various Macronutrient Distributions on Gut Microbiome and Metabolic Parameters: A Pilot Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Weight-loss meal replacement programs with protein-enriched diets improve gut microbiome diversity and butyrate-producing bacteria, while balanced and high-lipid/low-carbohydrate diets reduce body weight and BMI.

Abstract:It has emerged the gut microbiome is crucially linked to metabolic health and obesity. Macronutrient distribution has been discussed as a key parameter in weight-loss programs, but little is known about its impact on the gut microbiome. We investigated the effects of weight-loss meal replacement programs with different macronutrient ratios on the gut microbiota and metabolic parameters in subjects with overweight and obesity. Three low-calorie meal replacement programs with different ratios of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids were designed: a balanced diet (Group B, 60:15:30), a high-lipid−low-carbohydrate diet (Group F, 35:20:55), and a protein-enriched diet (Group P, 40:25:35). Sixty overweight or obese participants were provided with the meals twice daily for 3 weeks. In all groups, diet intervention resulted in reduced body weight and BMI. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla decreased and increased, respectively, which increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio in all subjects, particularly in Groups B and P. Alpha- and beta-diversity were augmented at the phylum level in Group P. In conclusion, short-term interventions with weight-loss meal replacement programs increased butyrate-producing bacteria and the F/B ratio. Moreover, the protein-enriched diet significantly increased alpha- and beta-diversity compared to the balanced diet and the high-lipid−low-carbohydrate diet.

The association between macronutrient intake and the metabolic syndrome and its components in type 1 diabetes

Number of 

Key takeaways:In individuals with type 1 diabetes, consuming more carbohydrates than fats may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome components, while consuming more carbohydrates or fats over proteins may lower blood pressure.

Abstract:Abstract Diet is a major modifiable lifestyle factor that may affect the components of the metabolic syndrome. We aimed to investigate the association between relative proportions of macronutrients and the components of the metabolic syndrome in a population of individuals with type 1 diabetes. In all, 791 individuals without nephropathy, with plausible energy intake and known metabolic syndrome status, taking part in the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study were included in the analyses. Dietary data were collected with a diet record. The association between the relative macronutrient intake and the outcome variables were analysed using multivariable nutrient density substitution models. The relative proportions of dietary macronutrients or fatty acids were not associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome. In men, however, favouring carbohydrates over fats was associated with lower odds of the waist component, whereas favouring either carbohydrates or fats over proteins was associated with lower odds of the blood pressure component of the metabolic syndrome. In women, substituting carbohydrates for fats was associated with lower HDL-cholesterol concentration. Substituting carbohydrates or fats for alcohol or protein was, in men, associated with lower systolic blood pressure. To conclude, the relative distribution of macronutrients may have some relevance for the metabolic syndrome.

Micronutrients impact the gut microbiota and blood glucose.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Dietary micronutrients influence gut microbiota and blood glucose, potentially impacting metabolic disease risk and endocrine control of glucose metabolism.

Abstract:Micronutrients influence hormone action and host metabolism. Dietary minerals, trace elements and vitamins can alter blood glucose and cellular glucose metabolism and several micronutrients are associated with risk and progression of type 2 diabetes. Dietary components, microbes and host immune, endocrine, and metabolic responses all interact in the intestine. There has been a focus on macronutrients modifying the host-microbe relationship in metabolic disease. Micronutrients are positioned to alter host-microbe symbiosis that participates in host endocrine control of glucose metabolism. Minerals and trace elements can alter the composition of the intestinal microbiota, gut barrier function, compartmentalized metabolic inflammation, cellular glucose transport and endocrine control of glucose metabolism, including insulin and thyroid hormones. Dietary vitamins also influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota and vitamins can be biotransformed by gut microbes. Host-microbe regulation of vitamins can alter immunity, lipid and glucose metabolism, and cell fate and function of pancreatic beta cells. Causal effects of micronutrients in host-microbe metabolism are still emerging and the mechanisms linking dietary excess or deficiency of specific micronutrients to changes in gut microbes directly linked to metabolic disease risk are not yet clear. Dietary fiber, fat, protein, and carbohydrates are key dietary factors that impact how microbes participate in host glucose metabolism. It is possible that micronutrient and microbiota-derived factors also participate in host-microbe responses that tip the balance in endocrine control of host glucose metabolism. Dietary micronutrients should be considered, tested, and controlled in preclinical and clinical studies investigating host-microbe factors in metabolic diseases.

Associations between Macronutrient Intakes and Obesity/Metabolic Risk Phenotypes: Findings of the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

Number of 

Key takeaways:No association was found between macronutrient intakes and obesity/metabolic risk phenotypes in the Korean population, except for a positive association between metabolically healthy but obese status and low protein intake in females.

Abstract:Obesity is a risk factor for many health issues, as are metabolic abnormalities. However, few studies have addressed the associations between obesity/metabolic risk phenotypes and dietary macronutrient intakes (carbohydrate, protein, and fat). Therefore, this study examined the associations between macronutrient intakes and obesity/metabolic risk phenotypes in a Korean population. We used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of Korean civilians, conducted in 2014 and 2016, and data on a total of 7374 participants were analyzed. Macronutrient intakes were defined as the proportions of energy derived from carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Those exhibiting obesity/metabolic risk phenotypes (or not) were divided into four groups: normal weight without metabolic abnormalities; obese without metabolic abnormalities; normal weight with metabolic abnormalities; and obese with metabolic abnormalities. After adjusting for age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, extent of physical activity, household income, and daily fiber intake, no association was found between the proportions of carbohydrate, protein, or fat intakes and obesity/metabolic risk phenotypes except for a positive association between metabolically healthy but obese status and low protein intake in females. Further studies are required to evaluate the effects of macronutrient intakes on obesity/metabolic risk phenotypes and associated health outcomes.

Quantitative analysis of the caloric restriction versus isocaloric diets models based on macronutrients composition: impacts on body weight regulation, anthropometric, and bioimpedance parameters in women with obesity

Number of 

Key takeaways:Isocaloric diets with varied macronutrient distributions provide superior long-term benefits for optimizing weight, BMI, body composition, and central adiposity in obese women.

Abstract:Introduction Obesity is a growing public health issue, especially among young adults, with long-term management strategies still under debate. This prospective study compares the effects of caloric restriction and isocaloric diets with different macronutrient distributions on body composition and anthropometric parameters in obese women during a 12-week weight loss program, aiming to identify the most effective dietary strategies for managing obesity-related health outcomes. Methods A certified clinical nutritionist assigned specific diets over a 12-week period to 150 participants, distributed as follows: hypocaloric diets—low-energy diet (LED, 31 subjects) and very low-energy diet (VLED, 13 subjects); isocaloric diets with macronutrient distribution—low-carbohydrate diet (LCD, 48 subjects), ketogenic diet (KD, 23 subjects), and high-protein diet (HPD, 24 subjects); and isocaloric diet without macronutrient distribution—time-restricted eating (TRE, 11 subjects). Participants were dynamically monitored using anthropometric parameters: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using the TANITA Body Composition Analyzer BC-418 MA III (T5896, Tokyo, Japan) at three key intervals—baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. The following parameters were evaluated: body weight, basal metabolic rate (BMR), percentage of total body fat, trunk fat, muscle mass, fat-free mass, and hydration status. Results All diets led to weight loss, but differences emerged over time. The TRE model resulted in significantly less weight loss compared to LED at the final follow-up (6.30 kg, p < 0.001), similar to the VLED (4.69 kg, p < 0.001). Isocaloric diets with varied macronutrient distributions showed significant weight loss compared to LED (p < 0.001). The KD reduced waist circumference at both 6 and 12 weeks (−4.08 cm, p < 0.001), while significant differences in waist-to-hip ratio reduction were observed across diet groups at 12 weeks (p = 0.01). Post-hoc analysis revealed significant fat mass differences at 12 weeks, with HPD outperforming IF (p = 0.01) and VLED (p = 0.003). LCD reduced trunk fat at 6 weeks (−2.36%, p = 0.001) and 12 weeks (−3.79%, p < 0.001). HPD increased muscle mass at 12 weeks (2.95%, p = 0.001), while VLED decreased it (−2.02%, p = 0.031). TRE showed a smaller BMR reduction at 12 weeks compared to LED. Conclusion This study highlights the superior long-term benefits of isocaloric diets with macronutrients distribution over calorie-restrictive diets in optimizing weight, BMI, body composition, and central adiposity.
