Abstract:IntroductionApple vinegar (AV) has been proclaimed to have different health benefits, such as a weight loss, the ability to lower blood glucose levels, and reducing the risk of heart diseases. Studies on animals have demonstrated effects of AV consumption, deepening our knowledge of the beneficial effects and side effects.AimThe aims of this study were to evaluate the evidence of the effect of AV on metabolic parameters and body weight in humans, furthermore, to evaluate the safety and side effects of ingesting AV, and additionally to evaluate the evidence of the effect of AV on metabolic parameters, safety, and side effects of AV from studies performed on animals (mammals).MethodsA systematic literature search was performed. The databases PubMed (MEDLINE), PsycInfo (Ebsco), CINAHL (Ebsco), and Embase (Ovid) were searched for relevant articles. Primary outcomes were glycated hemoglobin, postprandial glucose, and synonyms for blood glucose. Secondary outcomes were waist circumference, visceral fat, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Studies performed on humans and animals were included. The included studies performed on humans were quality assessed for risk of bias using a version of the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool.ResultsA total of 487 papers were identified in the literature search. Of these, 13 studies performed on humans and 12 studies performed on animals were included. There may be beneficial health effects from the consumption of AV. The risk of side effects when ingested in recommended quantities and in recommended ways seems inconsiderable.ConclusionDue to inadequate research of high quality, the evidence for the health effects of AV is insufficient. Therefore, more large-scale, long-term clinical studies with a low risk of bias are needed before definitive conclusions can be made.

Key takeaways:Apple Cider Vinegar reduces oxidative stress and reduces obesity-associated cardiovascular risk factors in high-fat-fed male Wistar rats by modulating antioxidant defense systems.

Abstract:Metabolic syndrome is a serious consequence of obesity characterized by increased cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance. While diets enriched with natural antioxidants showed beneficial effects on oxidative stress, blood pressure, and serum lipid composition, diet supplementation with synthetic antioxidants showed contradictive results. Thus, we tested, in this study, whether a daily dosage of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) would affect cardiovascular risk factor associated with obesity in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemic Wistar rats. Obese rats showed increased serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and atherogenic index after 6 and 9 weeks of being fed an HFD. Importantly, ACV ameliorated all of these parameters significantly. Oxidative stress already developed after 6 weeks of HFD and was significantly reduced by daily doses of ACV. Oral administration of ACV normalized various biochemical and metabolic changes since it exhibited a very significant (P < .001) reduction in malondialdehyde levels, whereas an increase in thiol group concentrations and antioxidant status (superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase , and catalase activities and vitamin E concentrations). In addition, a modulation in trace element levels was observed when compared with HFD groups. These findings suggested that HFD alters the oxidant-antioxidant balance, as evidenced by a reduction in the antioxidant enzyme activities and vitamin E level, and enhanced lipid peroxidation. ACV can be beneficial for the suppression of obesity-induced oxidative stress in HFD rats through the modulating antioxidant defense system and reduces the risk of obesity-associated diseases by preventing the atherogenic risk.

The ACV group consumed a daily ACV effervescent tablet, engaged in mild exercise, and followed a low-sugar diet, while the control group followed only the exercise and diet regimen. Anthropometric measurements and participant satisfaction data were collected throughout. The analysis revealed significant reductions in weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference, and waist-hip ratio over the 60-day period. Additionally, improvements were observed in abnormal food intake and various digestive issues such as appetite, constipation, cravings, and gas problems in the ACV group. Notably, 56.25% of control group participants and 44.44% of ACV group participants were categorized as overweight. Data analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, utilizing descriptive statistics such as mean and percentage. The study concluded that daily consumption of ACV effervescent tablets has a positive impact on weight loss and alleviates issues related to digestion and appetite. These findings underscore the potential benefits of incorporating ACV into dietary and lifestyle interventions for individuals with abnormal weight, suggesting its role as a complementary approach to promote overall health and well-being.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar supplementation significantly reduces weight gain and BMI in rats on a cafeteria diet, improving lipid profile and reducing gut microbiota damage.

Abstract:Obesity is well-recognized as a global epidemic and is associated with various co-morbidities. The intestinal microbiota seems to play a major role in the development of this pathology. In addition, environmental factors can modulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota and promote or prevent the development of metabolic abnormalities. This study is conducted to verify the impact of apple cider vinegar on lipid profile, intestinal structure and modulation of gut microbiota in Wistar rats subjected to a cafeteria diet. 24 male adult Wistar rats are divided into 3 equal groups. A witness group submitted to standard laboratory diet and two groups subjected to cafeteria diet; one receives a daily gavage of ACV (7 mL/kg/day) for 90 days. Anthropometric measurements are performed on d0 and d90. At the end of the experiment, the animals are sacrificed, the blood is collected for biochemical assays, the jejunal fragments are removed for histological study and the contents of the colon and feces are freshly collected under sterile conditions for microbiological study. Our results show that after 90 days of experimentation, the ACV supplementation leads to a highly significant (p≤0.001) decrease in weight gain and BMI compared to the RC group, correlated with an improvement of lipids profile and a highly significant decrease (p≤0.001) of Firmicutes (Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium) both in colon and faeces. In conclusion, ACV might have a positive impact on the control of weight gain by modulation of gut microbiota, thus prevent positive energy balance and reverse overweight and obesity.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) is a set of metabolic abnormalities that are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has been used in several studies as a natural agent to improve CMS risk factors. The present study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of ACV consumption on lipid and glycemic parameters.

METHODS
PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases were systematically searched to find clinical trials evaluating the effects of ACV consumption on CMS risk factors.

RESULTS
Overall, 25 clinical trials (33 arms) comprising 1320 adults were entered in this study. ACV consumption could significantly improve the levels of FBG (-21.20 mg/dl; 95% CI: -32.31 to -2.21; I2: 95.8%), HbA1c (-0.91mg/dl; 95% CI: -1.62 to -0.21; I2: 98.9%), and TC (-6.72 mg/dl; 95% CI: -12.91 to -0.53; I2:50.8%). No significant results were observed for BMI, HOMA-IR, serum insulin, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C. Subgroup analysis showed a significant decrease in FBG, HbA1c, TC, and TG in diabetic patients. In this type of analysis, ACV consumption significantly reduced FBG levels when administered for both duration subgroups (≥12 and <12 weeks). Moreover, in the subgroup analysis based on duration, TG concentration was significantly decreased following ACV consumption for ≥ 12 weeks.

CONCLUSION
This meta-analysis showed that consumption of ACV has a favorable effect in decreasing some CMS risk factors including FBG, HbA1c, and TC.

Abstract:Aim of Study: To explore the effectiveness of daily intake of apple cider vinegar (300mg, tablets 3 times daily) on lowering body mass index (BMI) among obese subjects. Methodology: A total of 100 obese subjects were randomized into either an intervention group (who received 300mg apple cider vinegar tablets three times daily in addition to their prescribed routine management protocol) or a control group (who received their prescribed routine management protocol only). The researchers met all participants in both groups once monthly to measure their body weight, inquire about any health complaints related to their followed protocol, and to provide health education. In addition, each participant in the intervention group was given his/her monthly doses of apple cider vinegar tables (90 tablets). Results: By the start of the study, there was no significant difference between participants in the invention group and those in the control group regarding their BMI (33.72 ±6.24 kg/m and 33.60±5.00kg/m , respectively, p=0.916). However, by the end of the study observation period (5 months), there was a significantly lower mean BMI among the intervention group than the control group (29.38 ±5.70kg/m and 31.59±4.68 kg/m , respectively, p=0.037), which was not sexor agedependent. Reported side effects were in the form of mild heart burn (12%) or transient diarrhea (10%). Conclusions: Apple cider vinegar can be safely prescribed for a short-term body weight reduction. Recommendations: Further studies are needed to explore the mechanism by which its intake is associated with weight loss and to identify its long-term side effects.

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar (ACV) at up to 2% may have positive effects on trout aquaculture and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease treatment.

Abstract:In this study, we aimed to experimentally induce fatty liver disease in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and then assessed the illness recovery process, growth, and changes in the expression of FAAH and ACADL genes in both healthy (0 and 4% apple cider vinegar ) and diseased fish (0 , 1 , 2 , and 4% ) apple cider vinegar. To conduct the study, 180 rainbow trout were randomly assigned to six different experimental treatments, each with three replications. The investigation lasted for 60 days. Growth indices, liver histology, blood biochemical parameters, and transcription of the ACADL and FAAH genes in the liver tissue were measured. The study found no significant differences in the final weights across all the treatments. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) administration resulted in a decrease in AST, ALT, and ALP; however, these values did not show a significant difference from C2. In T3, triglycerides significantly decreased (p < 0.05), whereas in T4, triglycerides significantly increased (p < 0.05). Hepatocytes from ACV‐containing treatments showed reduced fat compared with T4 and the control group (C1). While there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the expression of the FAAH gene, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the expression of the ACADL gene between experimental treatments. The findings of our study indicate that an inclusion of up to 2% ACV may have positive effects on trout aquaculture and NAFLD treatment.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar consumption significantly improves fasting plasma glucose and blood lipid levels, particularly in type 2 diabetes patients and those consuming it for over 8 weeks.

Abstract:Abstract Background Elevated lipid profiles and impaired glucose homeostasis are risk factors for several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which, subsequently, represent a leading cause of early mortality, worldwide. The aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of apple cider vinegar (ACV) on lipid profiles and glycemic parameters in adults. Methods A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases, including Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge, from database inception to January 2020. All clinical trials which investigated the effect of ACV on lipid profiles and glycemic indicators were included. Studies were excluded if ACV was used in combination with other interventions or when the duration of intervention was &lt; 2 weeks. To account for between-study heterogeneity, we performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Results Overall, nine studies, including 10 study arms, were included in this meta-analysis. We found that ACV consumption significantly decreased serum total cholesterol (− 6.06 mg/dL; 95% CI: − 10.95, − 1.17; I 2 : 39%), fasting plasma glucose (− 7.97 mg/dL; 95% CI: − 13.74, − 2.21; I 2 : 75%), and HbA1C concentrations (− 0.50; 95% CI: − 0.90, − 0.09; I 2 : 91%). No significant effect of ACV consumption was found on serum LDL-C, HDL-C, fasting insulin concentrations, or HOMA-IR. The stratified analysis revealed a significant reduction of serum TC and TG in a subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes, those who took ≤15 mL/day of ACV, and those who consumed ACV for &gt; 8-weeks, respectively. Furthermore, ACV consumption significantly decreased FPG levels in a subgroup of studies that administered ACV for &gt; 8-weeks. Further, ACV intake appeared to elicit an increase in FPG and HDL-C concentrations in apparently healthy participants. Conclusion We found a significant favorable effect of ACV consumption on FPG and blood lipid levels.

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar significantly reduces fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes patients, but does not affect insulin resistance.

Abstract:Background and aims Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multifactorial metabolic disorder that affects the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) could possibly improve diabetes; nevertheless, evidences provide conflicting results. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ACV on glycemic profile in type 2 diabetes patients (T2DM) in controlled trials (CTs) by systematically reviewing and dose–response meta-analysis. Methods The Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched until November 2024 according to a systematic approach. All CTs investigating ACV’s effects on glycemic factors were included. We used a random-effects model to calculate WMDs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The present study assessed publication bias, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and heterogeneity based on standard methods. We assessed the bias risk of the included studies using Cochrane quality assessments and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to calculate evidence certainty. We registered the study protocol at Prospero (no. CRD42023457493). Results Overall, we included seven studies in this meta-analysis. ACV significantly reduced fasting blood sugar (FBS) (WMD: −21.929 mg/dL, 95% CI: −29.19, −14.67, p < 0.001) and HbA1c (WMD: −1.53, 95% CI: −2.65, −0.41, p = 0.008) and increased insulin (WMD: 2.059 μu/ml, 95% CI: 0.26, 3.86, p = 0.025), while it did not affect hemostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We observed linear and non-linear associations between ACV consumption and FBS levels (p < 0.001). Each 1 mL/day increase in ACV consumption was associated with a-1.255 mg/dL reduction in FBS. Moreover, greater effects on FBS were in dosages >10. Conclusion ACV had positive effects on FBS and HbA1c in T2DM patients. Systematic Review Registration The study protocol was registered at Prospero (no. CRD42023457493).

Number of 

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar supplementation reduces insulin resistance and supports weight loss, potentially improving insulin sensitivity, but more research is needed.

Abstract:Introduction and purpose: The topic of apple cider vinegar supplementation and insulinresistance is becoming increasingly widespread, especially on the internet, which carriesmany potential risks. There is a need to understand both how apple cider vinegar reducesinsulin resistance and improves metabolic parameters, as well as the potential risks of its use.Material and methods: Medical databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase weresearched for scientific papers on the safety, benefits, mechanisms, and risks of apple cidervinegar in insulin resistance and related conditions. These were analyzed and summarized ina single review.State of knowledge: Apple cider vinegar supplementation contributes to a reduction ininsulin resistance, which is reflected in parameters such as decreased postprandial insulinsecretion, lower levels of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC), reduced fastingglucose, lower HbA1c levels, and supports weight loss, potentially improving insulinsensitivity. In most cases, no adverse effects or serious side effects were observed with dosesof 15-30 ml per day. However, potential risks include delayed gastric emptying, exacerbationof gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastrointestinal disturbances, tooth erosion,although one study suggests that such supplementation may be associated with acutepancreatitis.Conclusions: More research is needed on supplementation, particularly regarding itsduration. Another risk is the search for health information online without critically evaluatingthe content. Weight loss through a proper diet and exercise appears to be key for improvinginsulin sensitivity, but supplementation may help achieve results in certain patient groups.

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar supplementation improves performance, immune response, and small intestine histomorphology in broiler chickens.

Abstract:Abstract The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of apple cider vinegar in diet on the growth performance, immune response, histomorphological changes of the small intestine and some serum biochemical factors in broilers. A total of 85 broiler chicks of Ross 308 were purchased and 64 well‐conditioned chicks were selected and divided into four experimental groups with four replicates and four chicks per replicate. The diets of groups 2, 3 and 4 were mixed with 1, 2 and 3% of vinegar, respectively, and group 1 as the control group was fed by the standard diet. The results showed that body weight gain was higher in the groups fed vinegar than the control group. There were no significant changes in the feed conversion ratio between the treatment and control groups (p = .507). Vinegar intake through the diet did not change significantly the weight of Bursa of Fabricius (p = .369) and spleen (p = .122). Vinegar significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen levels in the treatment groups compared with the control group (p = .0052). There was a significant increase in the level of antibody titre against Newcastle disease virus by haemagglutination inhibition test in the groups receiving vinegar in comparison with control group (p = .0358). Compared with the control group, the villus height (p = .0022) and intestinal crypts depth (p = .0015) significantly increased in the groups receiving apple cider vinegar. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with apple cider vinegar has beneficial effects on performance, immune response and small intestine histomorphology in broilers.

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar consumption for 8 weeks significantly reduced harmful blood lipids, making it a simple and cost-effective treatment for hyperlipidemia.

Abstract:Apple cider vinegar has been traditionally used since many years ago to treat a certain number of diseases including hyperlipidemia which is known as a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Early prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis can prevent complications of cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the present study aimed to review the influence of apple cider vinegar consumption on reducing blood lipid levels. This quasi-experiment study(time series design) was carried out on 19 patients with hyperlipidemia. The subjects had been referred to a cardiologist and agreed to consume apple cider vinegar. At baseline, blood samples were obtained to measure cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL). The tests were repeated at two, four, and eight weeks of vinegar consumption. The results were analyzed using repeated measurement analysis. There were significant reduction in the serum levels of total cholesterol (p < 0.001), triglyceride (p = 0.020), and LDL (p = 0.001) after eight weeks of consuming apple cider vinegar and with an increased HDL levels but the trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.200). Consumption of apple cider vinegar over a 8 week period had a beneficial effect in significant reductions in harmful blood lipids and is recommended as a simple and cost-effective treatment for hyperlipidemia.

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar improves the lipid profile and reduces cardiovascular risk in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by reducing total cholesterol and increasing HDL-C levels.

Abstract:The benefic effects of vinegar have been known for more than a century and have been demonstrated in animal as well as human studies. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of apple cider vinegar on lipid profile, biomarkers of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Male albino rats were used for the present investigation. The animals were fasted overnight and diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of freshly prepared streptozotocin (STZ) (65mg/kg) in citrate buffer. Vinegar cider was orally administrated to the diabetic rats. Control rats were injected with citrate buffer only and the animals were considered as diabetic, if their blood glucose values were above 250mg/dl on the third day after STZ injection. The treatment had started on the fourth day after STZ injection and this day was considered as the first day of treatment that was continued for 4 weeks. In the plasma of the animals we determined the total cholesterol (CT), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels, alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) activities. We evaluated also CT/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C and LDL/HDL-C ratios and the atherogenic index (AI). Our treatment significantly reduced the CT values, LDL-C levels, TG levels, CT/HDL-C ratio, TG/HDL-C ratio, LDL/HDL-C ratio, AI, ALT and AST activities but increased HDL-C levels. These results indicate that apple cider improved the serum lipid profile related to the cardiovascular risk in diabetes mellitus. .

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar consumption significantly reduces diastolic blood pressure in medical students, but may increase weight.

Abstract:Apple cider vinegar, a sour vinegar with a seemingly sweet name is becoming trendy due to its wide variety of uses ranging from culinary uses to its speculated medicinal uses. This study is a randomised control trial aimed at investigating the effects of apple cider vinegar on the blood glucose levels, blood pressure, heart rate and weight of MMMC medical students. The side effects are also investigated. 60 Participants from batch 37 with 30 being in the control group and 30 being in the test group were assessed with a questionnaire after fulfilling certain inclusion and exclusion criteria their mood, energy levels, concentration and side effects were assessed after consuming apple cider vinegar for 5 days. Their blood glucose levels, blood pressure, heart rate and weight are also measured on the 1st and 5th day of the study and compared. The control group has no significant changes in the variables. However, for the apple cider vinegar group, there is a decrease in all the mentioned variables except the weight of the participants which showed an increase. The only significant change is that of the diastolic blood pressure of the apple cider vinegar group from a mean of 79.2mmHg to 70.3 mmHg with the paired T test and P-value testing being 3.34 and 0.002 respectively. Apple cider vinegar, if consumed will reduce the diastolic blood pressure of an individual. Its significance on other variables has to be further studied for a longer duration.

Abstract:Background and Objectives: Metabolic changes in postprandial stage, especially after consumption of high fat meal cause atherosclerosis and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Apple cider vinegar is an acidic juice with useful medicinal effects. In this research; we investigated acute effects of apple cider vinegar intake on some of the biochemical atherosclerosis risk factors in high cholesterol fed rabbits. Methods: Thirty two male New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: normal diet group, high cholesterol diet group (%1cholesterol), %1 cholesterol with 5ml apple cider vinegar group, %1 cholesterol with 10ml apple cider vinegar group. The C-Reactive Protein (CRP), low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized-LDL (OxLDL), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), nitrite, nitrate, glucose, fibrinogen triacylglycerol (TG), apolipoprotein A (ApoA1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB100) were all measured before the experiment and three hours after feeding with these treatment diets. Results: In high cholesterol diet fibrinogen, nitrite, glucose, OxLDL, MDA and CRP showed a significant increase compared to normal diet. Significant differences were observed between both groups of apple cider vinegar by fibrinogen in comparison with hypercholesterolemic diet. Using 10ml apple cider vinegar with cholesterolemic diet caused a significant reduction in Ox-LDL, MDA and glucose in comparison with hypercholesterolemic diet. Moreover, the consumption of 5ml apple cider vinegar with cholesterolemic diet caused a significant decrease in LDL-C and TC compared to hypercholesterolemic diet. No significant difference was found between apple cider vinegar taking groups and hypercholesterol diet in CRP, TG ApoA, HDL-C, ApoB, SGOT, SGPT, nitrite and nitrate. Conclusion: The results showed that acute consumption of apple cider vinegar (as an antioxidant) causes significant reduction on some risk factors of atherosclerosis

Abstract:The objective of this study was to investigate the anticoccidial effect of apple cider vinegar added to drinking water with the anticoccidial effect of amprolium to feed broiler chicken. The study has adopted an observational approach to evaluate the anticoccidial effect of apple cider vinegar on broiler chicken. The antioxidative changes were measured adding natural apple cider vinegar to drinking water. Four hundred and fifty broiler chickens were purchased from the local market and distributed into three groups (T+vc: positive control, T-vc: negative control Tv: apple cider vinegar) with 150 chickens in each group. The three groups were further replicated into 3 blocks each containing 50 chickens. The groups were fed balanced diet, amprolium was added to the feed of positive control group, and apple cider vinegar was added to the water of Tv group. Measurements of the different variables were started from week 3, at the end of each week 3 birds were chosen randomly, blood samples were collected via the wing vein, and fecal oocysts were counted from intestinal contents of each individual bird using the McMaster technique. Broiler in the control groups T+ve and T-ve showed clinical signs of coccidiosis (blood in feces) and the number of coccidial oocytes in feces increased with time. In the vinegar group, no clinical signs of coccidiosis were observed. Concentrations of total antioxidants and catalase enzyme activity significantly increased (p≤0.05); while malondialdehyde concentration significantly decreased (p≤0.05).

Number of 

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar is often used to aid digestion and treat fungal infections and sunburn, but its effect on weight, blood pressure, or acne remains unproven.

Abstract:"Apple cider vinegar a day keeps the doctor away" doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does it? Even still, many people claim that this product of fermented crushed apples yields a variety of health benefits including those that you mentioned. Usually taken in liquid, powder, or pill form before meals, it's most often used to aid digestion since the high acetic acid content helps break down food. In addition to this, it has also been used for centuries to treat fungal infections and sunburn. Although this may spark a domino effect on other aspects of health, there is no scientific proof that it has any effect on weight, blood pressure, or acne.

Abstract:Background: The hawthorn fruit is an interesting medicinal plant that has several biological features, especially related to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immune-modulating actions, and boosting general health. In this study, we aimed to clarify the immunological effects of hawthorn vinegar on immunity and general health. We also focused on three different production processes to improve the antioxidant activity of hawthorn vinegar (2) Methods: In the study, besides the traditional production of hawthorn vinegar (N), thermal pasteurization (P) and ultrasound (U) techniques were applied to vinegars. A total of 56 female adult Wistar albino rats were randomly allocated into seven groups; Control, N0.5 (regular vinegar; 0.5 mL/kgbw), N1 (regular vinegar; 1 mL/kgbw), P0.5 (pasteurized vinegar; 0.5 mL/kgbw), P1 (pasteurized vinegar; 1 mL/kgbw), U0.5 (ultrasound treated vinegar; 0.5 mL/kgbw), and U1 (ultrasound treated vinegar; 1 mL/kgbw). Vinegars were administered by oral gavage daily. The average weight gains, body mass index, and blood hematological parameters were measured, and the Neutrophil Lymphocyte ratio was calculated. The plasma IL-1β and TNF-α values, and MDA, IL-1β and TNF-α values of intestinal tissue, were determined. Also, the streptavidin–biotin–peroxidase complex method was applied to determine the expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β in duodenum. (3) Results: There was a decreasing tendency in the average weight gains in all vinegar groups compared to the control group. In addition, there was an increase in NL ratio in all vinegar groups, although not significant. There were no statistical differences among all vinegar groups, although decreases were observed in plasma IL-1β. Also, the plasma TNF-α values showed slight increases in high-dose-of-vinegar groups (N1, P1 and U1), although not significant. In addition, the intestinal tissue IL-1β value tended to increase in groups N0.5, N1 and P0.5, while it tended to decrease in P1, U0.5 and U1. On the other hand, there were slight increases in the TNF-α values of intestinal tissue in all groups compared to control, although these were not significant. Furthermore, the intensive expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β were determined in groups U0.5 and U1. (4) Conclusions: The results suggest that either high doses or ultrasound applications of hawthorn vinegar have positive effects on intestinal health, boosting immunity and general health.

Abstract:Colon cancer is the most threatening cases in the contemporary world due to sedentary lifestyles, changes in eating habits, genetics and etiological factors. The latest statistics proves that it is expected to cause about 50,630 deaths every year. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) has been proved to be a very constructive and effective therapy for cancer, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, urolithiasis and skin infections. Objective: The aim of the present work is mainly to evaluate the antioxidant and anticancer properties of apple cider, since there is not much literature supporting the same. Methodology: This work is a laboratory controlled prospective study conducted in our premises. ACV was prepared with ethanol and aqueous fermentation extraction method. Various established (5μg/ml, 10μg/ml, 15μg/ml, 20μg/ml, 25μg/ml and 30μg/ml) concentrations were prepared for further studies. The phytochemical analysis was performed and the DPPH assay was done for evaluating the antioxidant potency. MTT assay was performed for the evaluation of anticancer action against colon cancer cell lines (HT29) for the diluted concentrations to achieve the minimum inhibitory concentration. Results: The DPPH radical scavenging activity of ACV was found to be ranging from 46.14% to 86.75%for the various concentration ranges. The IC50 value of the extract was found to be 8μg/ml. The HT-29 cancer cell line subjected to various concentrations of apple cider vinegar, resulted in cell viability of 48.90% at 62.5μg/ml. From the graph IC50 value was calculated to be around 50-60μg/ml. Conclusion: It was concluded ACV is biologically active and effective against colon cancer.

Effect of apple cider vinegar on delayed gastric emptying in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a pilot study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Apple cider vinegar significantly reduces gastric emptying rate in type 1 diabetes patients with diabetic gastroparesis, potentially negatively impacting glycemic control.

Abstract:Previous studies on healthy people show that vinegar delays gastric emptying and lowers postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of apple cider vinegar on delayed gastric emptying rate on diabetes mellitus patients. Ten patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic gastroparesis, including one patient who had undergone vagotomy, were included and completed the investigator blinded crossover trial. The gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured using standardized real-time ultrasonography. The GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15 and 90 minutes after ingestion of 300 g rice pudding and 200 ml water (GER1), or 300 g rice pudding and 200 ml water with 30 ml apple cider vinegar (GER2). The subjects drank 200 ml water daily before breakfast one week before the measurement of GER1. The same subjects drank 200 ml water with 30 ml vinegar daily before breakfast for two weeks before the measurement of GER2. The median values of GER1 and GER2 were 27% and 17%, respectively. The effect of vinegar on the rate of gastric emptying was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This study shows that vinegar affects insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with diabetic gastroparesis by reducing the gastric emptying rate even further, and this might be a disadvantage regarding to their glycaemic control.
