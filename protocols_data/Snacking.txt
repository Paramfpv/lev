Risk of obesity, metabolic disorders, and negative impact on mental health

Snacking on unhealthy foods, especially those high in sugars, fats, and salt, has a negative effect on metabolism. Regular consumption of such snacks increases the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, lipid disorders, and metabolic syndrome, even if it does not lead to excessive calorie intake. Long-term snacking can also affect mental health, leading to depression, anxiety, and stress.

Level of evidence:Preliminary

Unhealthy snacks, rich in high-calorie trans fats, salt, and sugars, cause fluctuations in insulin and leptin levels, leading to insulin resistance. Frequent consumption of such products also promotes an increase in fat tissue, especially abdominal fat, and worsens mental health. Metabolic disorders, such as an increased risk of obesity and diabetes, result from long-term uncontrolled snacking.

Snacking on unhealthy snacks, especially those rich in sugars, trans fats, and salt, is confirmed by numerous epidemiological studies and health interventions. Long-term consumption of these products leads to serious health problems such as obesity, insulin resistance, lipid disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.

Snacking on unhealthy snacks is a common habit in many countries, especially in developed nations. With the growing problem of obesity, many studies have confirmed that frequent consumption of these products has a significant impact on public health.

Choose healthy snacks

Instead of chips and sweets, choose snacks rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats, such as nuts, natural yogurts, or fruits.

Plan your meals to avoid the need for snacking. Regular eating will help maintain your energy level and prevent snacking.

Pay attention to your emotions before reaching for a snack. If you feel stressed, try relaxing breathing exercises or a walk instead of a snack.

If you need to have a snack, control portions to avoid overeating. Regularly consuming small portions will have a better effect on your health.

Snacking on unhealthy snacks, especially those high in sugars, fats, and salt, has a clearly negative effect on metabolism. Regular consumption of unhealthy snacks increases the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, lipid disorders, and metabolic syndrome, even if it does not lead to excessive calorie intake.

Impact on metabolism and risk of metabolic diseases

Frequency of snacking

Snacking on unhealthy snacks, such as salty and sweet snacks, fast food, or sugary drinks, is clearly associated with poorer mental health. Regular consumption of unhealthy snacks increases the risk of depression, stress, anxiety, and lower well-being in both adults and children and adolescents.

Key research findings

Mechanisms and additional observations

Snacking on unhealthy snacks may negatively affect body composition, especially if the snacks are high-calorie, rich in sugars and fats, and low in nutrients. Regular consumption of unhealthy snacks is associated with a higher level of body fat and a greater risk of overweight or obesity, especially in people who are already overweight.

Abstract:The increase in obesity and lipid disorders in industrialized countries may be due to irregular eating patterns. Few studies have investigated the effects of nighttime snacking on energy metabolism. We examined the effects of nighttime snacking for 13 days on energy metabolism. Eleven healthy women (means ± SD; age: 23 ± 1 yr; body mass index: 20.6 ± 2.6 kg/m(2)) participated in this randomized crossover trial for a 13-day intervention period. Subjects consumed a specified snack (192.4 ± 18.3 kcal) either during the daytime (10:00) or the night time (23:00) for 13 days. On day 14, energy metabolism was measured in a respiratory chamber without snack consumption. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed on day 15. Relative to daytime snacking, nighttime snacking significantly decreased fat oxidation (daytime snacking: 52.0 ± 13.6 g/day; nighttime snacking: 45.8 ± 14.0 g/day; P = 0.02) and tended to increase the respiratory quotient (daytime snacking: 0.878 ± 0.022; nighttime snacking: 0.888 ± 0.021; P = 0.09). The frequency of snack intake and energy intake, body weight, and energy expenditure were not affected. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol significantly increased after nighttime snacking (152 ± 26 mg/dl and 161 ± 29 mg/dl; P = 0.03 and 76 ± 20 mg/dl and 83 ± 24 mg/dl; P = 0.01, respectively), but glucose and insulin levels after the glucose load were not affected. Nighttime snacking increased total and LDL cholesterol and reduced fat oxidation, suggesting that eating at night changes fat metabolism and increases the risk of obesity.

Snack Food, Satiety, and Weight.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Healthful snacks, such as whole foods high in protein, fiber, and whole grains, can enhance satiety and promote appetite control, potentially reducing obesity risk.

Abstract:In today's society, snacking contributes close to one-third of daily energy intake, with many snacks consisting of energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods. Choices made with regard to snacking are affected by a multitude of factors on individual, social, and environmental levels. Social norms, for example, that emphasize healthful eating are likely to increase the intake of nutrient-rich snacks. In addition, satiety, the feeling of fullness that persists after eating, is an important factor in suppressing overconsumption, which can lead to overweight and obesity. Thus, eating snacks between meals has the potential to promote satiety and suppress overconsumption at the subsequent meal. Numerous studies have explored the relation between snack foods and satiety. These studies concluded that whole foods high in protein, fiber, and whole grains (e.g., nuts, yogurt, prunes, and popcorn) enhance satiety when consumed as snacks. Other foods that are processed to include protein, fiber, or complex carbohydrates might also facilitate satiety when consumed as snacks. However, studies that examined the effects of snack foods on obesity did not always account for satiety and the dietary quality and portion size of the snacks consumed. Thus, the evidence concerning the effects of snack foods on obesity has been mixed, with a number of interventional and observational studies not finding a link between snack foods and increased weight status. Although further prospective studies are warranted to conclusively determine the effects of snack foods on obesity risk, the consumption of healthful snacks likely affects satiety and promotes appetite control, which could reduce obesity.

The Influence of Socioeconomic Status on Snacking and Weight among Adolescents: A Scoping Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Snacking habits among adolescents show a weak but potential link to socioeconomic status, but do not significantly affect weight-related outcomes.

Abstract:Eating behaviors, including unhealthy snacking or excessive snacking leading to excess calorie consumption, may contribute to obesity among adolescents. Socioeconomic status (SES) also significantly influences eating behaviors, and low SES is associated with increased risk for obesity. However, little is known regarding the relationship between snacking behavior and SES among adolescents and how this may contribute to obesity-related outcomes. The primary objective of this scoping review was to review the literature to assess and characterize the relationship between SES and snacking in adolescents. The secondary objective was to assess weight-related outcomes and their relation to snacking habits. Included articles were published between January 2000 and May 2019; written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish; and focused on adolescents (13–17 years). In total, 14 bibliographic databases were searched, and seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Preliminary evidence from the seven included studies suggests a weak but potential link between SES and snacking. Additionally, these dietary patterns seemed to differ by sex and income type of country. Finally, only three of the included studies addressed weight-related outcomes, but the overall available evidence suggests that snacking does not significantly affect weight-related outcomes. Due to the small number of included studies, results should be interpreted with caution.

The Global Epidemic of the Metabolic Syndrome

Number of 

Key takeaways:Metabolic syndrome, caused by high calorie-low fiber fast food and decreased physical activity, has become a global health issue, with potential for global solutions through better urban planning, whole grain consumption, and promoting healthy lifestyles.

Abstract:Metabolic syndrome, variously known also as syndrome X, insulin resistance, etc., is defined by WHO as a pathologic condition characterized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Though there is some variation in the definition by other health care organization, the differences are minor. With the successful conquest of communicable infectious diseases in most of the world, this new non-communicable disease (NCD) has become the major health hazard of modern world. Though it started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts. The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities. The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities. The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions. The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it. There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments. For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of unhealthy food, etc. Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be considered.

Snacking in nutrition and health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Snacking, rather than three standard meals, can improve human health by distributing energy and nutrient intake across 4-5 eating occasions per day, with optimal snack composition and timing varying across age and population groups.

Abstract:Abstract Many studies suggest that distributing energy and nutrient intake across 4–5 eating occasions/day (rather than across three standard meals) could favourably affect human health. The inclusion of 1–2 snacks in the daily pattern alleviates the potential digestive and metabolic overload caused by fewer heavier meals and might contribute to meet recommendations for food groups (e.g. fruits, dairy) and nutrients like fibre and vitamins. The snack composition should be evaluated taking into account the whole day’s diet. In early and late ages, and for specific population groups, snacking may need to follow particular characteristics in order to be optimal, both in terms of composition and timing. This document, which is the result of a collaboration of experts across several fields of research, intends to provide a review of the current scientific literature on meal frequency and health, highlighting the beneficial effects of correct snack consumption across the human lifespan.

Consumption of Tree Nuts as Snacks Reduces Metabolic Syndrome Risk in Young Adults: A Randomized Trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:Daily tree nut consumption reduces metabolic syndrome risk in young adults by improving waist circumference, lipid biomarkers, and/or insulin sensitivity without requiring caloric restriction.

Abstract:Metabolic syndrome (MetSx) and its chronic disease consequences are major public health concerns worldwide. Between-meal snacking may be a modifiable risk factor. We hypothesized that consuming tree nuts as snacks, versus typical carbohydrate snacks, would reduce risk for MetSx in young adults. A prospective, randomized, 16-week parallel-group diet intervention trial was conducted in 84 adults aged 22–36 with BMI 24.5 to 34.9 kg/m2 and ≥1 MetSx clinical risk factor. Tree nuts snacks (TNsnack) were matched to carbohydrate snacks (CHOsnack) for energy (kcal), protein, fiber, and sodium content as part of a 7-day eucaloric menu. Difference in change between groups was tested by analysis of covariance using general linear models. Multivariable linear regression modeling assessed main effects of TNsnack treatment and interactions between TNsnack and sex on MetSx score. Age, BMI, and year of study enrollment were included variables. There was a main effect of TNsnack on reducing waist circumference in females (mean difference: −2.20 ± 0.73 cm, p = 0.004) and a trend toward reduced visceral fat (−5.27 ± 13.05 cm2, p = 0.06). TNsnack decreased blood insulin levels in males (−1.14 ± 1.41 mIU/L, p = 0.05) and multivariable modeling showed a main effect of TNsnack on insulin. Main effects of TNsnack on triglycerides and TG/HDL ratio were observed (p = 0.04 for both) with TG/HDL ratio reduced ~11%. A main effect of TNsnack (p = 0.04) and an interaction effect between TNsnack and sex (p < 0.001) on total MetSx score yielded 67% reduced MetSx score in TNsnack females and 42% reduced MetSx score in TNsnack males. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized parallel-arm study to investigate cardiometabolic responses to TNsnacks versus typical CHOsnacks among young adults at risk of MetSx. Our study suggests daily tree nut consumption reduces MetSx risk by improving waist circumference, lipid biomarkers, and/or insulin sensitivity—without requiring caloric restriction.

Sleep Deprivation: Effects on Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance

Number of 

Key takeaways:Sleep deprivation leads to increased energy intake and unhealthy snacking, hindering weight loss efforts and affecting overall health.

Abstract:This narrative review presents the findings from intervention studies on the effects of sleep deprivation on eating habits, metabolic rate, and the hormones regulating metabolism, and discusses their relevance to weight loss efforts. Disturbed sleeping patterns lead to increased energy intake, partly from excessive snacking, mainly on foods high in fat and carbohydrates. The studies focused mainly on the effects of sleep duration, but also of sleep quality, on dietary intake during weight loss trials, and on weight loss maintenance. It is important to explore sleep routines that could enhance the efforts of obese and overweight people to lose weight, maintain their weight loss, and improve their overall health.

Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Low Glycaemic Index Multi-Millet Snack

Number of 

Key takeaways:A nutritious multi millet snack developed using food technologies has a low glycemic index (45.7), promoting health-conscious and diabetic-friendly dietary choices.

Abstract:The prevalence of metabolic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol, has been closely linked to dietary habits characterized by a high intake of refined carbohydrates and unhealthy fats. Addressing this issue through healthy eating practices is crucial in preventing the onset of these disorders. However, popular snacks in society often contribute to unhealthy diets. In response, this study aimed to develop a nutritious multi millet snack using food technologies like protein extraction, extrusion puff technology, tumble blending and no-fry oil treatment. The nutritional analysis revealed high protein and high fibre content, as well as a low-fat profile. Clinical evaluation of the snack on 16 human volunteers demonstrated a low glycemic index (GI) 45.7, indicating slower sugar release into the bloodstream. The experiment's outcome presents a promising avenue for promoting health-conscious and diabetic-friendly dietary choices. The study underscores the potential of combining food technologies with millet-based formulations to create foods that align with the needs of individuals seeking to maintain or improve their metabolic health. Further investigations and long-term studies are needed to evaluate benefits of this multi millet snack on cholesterol and obesity when used as a replacement to regular dietary practices Key Words: Food technology, Millet, Snack, healthy, Low Glycemic index, GI

Meal habits and metabolic status in Southern Italian adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Eating habits, such as skipping breakfast, having unhealthy snacks, and having out-of-home meals, are associated with metabolic health in Southern Italian adults.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Recently eating habits, such as breakfast, snaking, and out-of-home meals, have been shown to influence metabolic health of general population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the association between meal habits and metabolic status in Southern Italian adults. METHODS: Data from the Mediterranean healthy Eating, Aging and Lifestyle study was used, including a total of 1952 subjects. RESULTS: Individuals having type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemias, and hypertension were more likely to adhere to a diet characterized by skipping breakfast, having unhealthy snacks and having out-of-home meals. Having breakfast was associated with higher odds of having dyslipidemias (OR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.74, 4.23); having snacks was associated with higher odds of being obese (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.42, 3.09); and having out-of-home meals was associated with higher odds of having dyslipidemias (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.32) and hypertension (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.21). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that eating habits may be associated with metabolic status in adults living in the Mediterranean area.

Dietary patterns and physical activity in the metabolically (un)healthy obese: the Dutch Lifelines cohort study

Number of 

Key takeaways:A healthier diet of fruit, vegetables, and fish, and moderate physical activity may help prevent metabolically unhealthy obesity, while a carbohydrate-rich 'bread, potatoes, and sweet snacks' diet may counteract it in women.

Abstract:Diversity in the reported prevalence of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO), suggests that modifiable factors may be at play. We evaluated differences in dietary patterns and physical activity between MHO and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO). Cross-sectional data of 9270 obese individuals (30–69 years) of the Lifelines Cohort Study was used. MHO was defined as obesity and no metabolic syndrome risk factors and no cardiovascular disease history. MUO was defined as obesity and ≥2 metabolic syndrome risk factors. Sex-specific associations of dietary patterns (identified by principal component analysis) and physical activity with MHO were assessed by multivariable logistic regression (reference group: MUO). Analyses were adjusted for multiple covariates. Among 3442 men and 5828 women, 10.2% and 24.4% had MHO and 56.9% and 35.3% MUO, respectively. We generated four obesity-specific dietary patterns. Two were related to MHO, and in women only. In the highest quartile (Q) of 'bread, potatoes and sweet snacks' pattern, odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) for MHO was 0.52 (0.39–0.70). For the healthier pattern 'fruit, vegetables and fish', an OR of 1.36 (1.09–1.71) in Q3 and 1.55 (1.21–1.97) in Q4 was found for MHO. For physical activity, there was a positive association between moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity in the highest tertile and MHO in women and men, respectively (OR 1.19 (1.01–1.41) and OR 2.02 (1.50–2.71)). The healthier diet -characterized by 'fruit, vegetables and fish'- and moderate physical activity in women, and vigorous physical activity in men may be related to MHO. The (refined) carbohydrate-rich 'bread, potatoes and sweet snacks' dietary pattern was found to counteract MHO in women.

Joint association of meal frequency and diet quality with metabolic syndrome in Iranian adults

Number of 

Key takeaways:Increased frequency of eating occasions and snacks may be associated with a higher chance of metabolic syndrome, with beneficial associations of diet quality being overshadowed.

Abstract:Abstract Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common complication that has been shown in various studies to be related to the frequency and timing of eating. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between meal timing and frequency with diet quality and prevalence of MetS. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods We analyzed data from 850 adults (20 to 59 years) and divided the participants into different categories in terms of frequency of eating occasions (EO) (5 ≥ , 6–7 and 7 &lt;), meal (2 ≥ and 3) and snack (2 ≥ , 3 and 4 ≤) in a day. Daily food consumption was assessed using the structured three 24-h recalls. The quality of diet we calculated using the food quality score (FQS). Metabolic syndrome was defined based on the guidelines of the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III (ATP III). The covariates-adjusted relationships between exposures and outcomes were investigated using a logistic regression test and two-way ANOVA. Results The overall prevalence of MetS in participants was 34.2%. The average FQS was 28.0. Increased frequency of EOs and snacks was related to the higher prevalence of MetS ((OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.24, 2.37; P &lt; 0.01) and (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07, 1.68; P, 0.01), respectively). The adjusted mean of FQS was not significantly different between the EO as well as meals and snack categories. The joint association of EO frequency and snack frequency with diet quality showed a higher chance of having MetS ( (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.19, 4.66; P, 0.01 and (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.06, 2.68; P,0.02), respectively). Also, we observed a higher mean of high density level cholesterol in people with the highest FQS and lowest EO frequency (P,0.02). Conclusion Our findings suggest that the EO and snack frequency may be associated with the higher chance of MetS. We also found when the frequency of EO increases, the beneficial associations of the diet quality were overshadowed. To confirm our findings, well designed randomised clinical trials are needed.

Key takeaways:A low-carb, high-fat, 3-fold meal diet with lunch before 3 PM effectively reduces BMI, waist, body fat, and HOMA-IR in patients with metabolic syndrome.

Abstract:Objectives:The aimof this studywas to assess the effect of bothmeal timing and diet composition on BMI, waist, body fat and HOMA-IR in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods:We studied 77 patients with MS (32 men and 45 women). Detailed analysis of baseline food-diaries showed that 43 patients (56%) were mostly eating after 3 p.m., generally skipping breakfast, and had more frequent carbohydrate snacks. We divided patients into two groups. The first group consisted of patients with most caloric intake after 3 PM, and the second group included patients who were evenly consuming their food throughout the day. Following diet were offered: 3-fold meal (food intake was at 7–9a.m., 1–2p.m. and 6–7p.m.) with very low-carbohydrate (LC) breakfast and dinner, lunch consisted of LC, proteins (P), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and non-starchy vegetables(V); there were absolutely no snacks during the day. Daily calorie intake was reduced by 20% from baseline. Diet intervention lasted 12 weeks. No medication were used during this period. Results: 60 patients completed the trial (32 and 28 patients in first and second groups respectively). BMI was reduced from 33,1 ± 5,0 kg/m2 to 29,8 ± 4,6 kg/m2, the effect was similar in both groups (Cohen’s d = 0,7, P = 0003). Mean body fat decreased from 40,7 ± 7,0% to 35,8 ± 7,5% in 12 weeks and treatment effect was more pronounced in second group (Cohen’s d = 0,76, P = 0007). The most significant changes were observed in HOMA-IR, which decreased from 4,0 ± 1,1 to 2,1 ± 1,1, treatment effect was also more pronounced in second group (Cohen’s d = 1,22, P = 0001). Waist circumference statistically decreased too (from 100,9 ± 16,8сm to 92,0 ± 14,6сm), although with more modest effect Cohen’s d = 0,58, P = 0003. Maximum effect size was in HOMA-IR changes. whereas minimum in waist circumference. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that this diet (low carb, hight fat, 3-fold meal diet with lunch before 3 p.m.) is associated with statistically different changes in BMI, waist, body fat andHOMA-IR and the intervention was more effective among patients in second group.

Comfort eating: An observational study of affect in the hours immediately before, and after, snacking.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Unhealthy snacking worsens affect before it occurs, but healthy snack intake leads to positive affective experiences, questioning the effectiveness of comfort eating.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE
'Comfort eating' has been used to explain real-world food choices, suggesting that individuals are drawn to energy-dense ('unhealthy') snacks when experiencing negative affect. However, this concept has rarely been studied, particularly in real-world settings. Similarly, the effects of snacking on subsequent affect are also poorly understood. The present study aimed to examine the association between affect and snacking in daily life.

METHODS
One hundred and forty-one adults recorded their food intake in real time for ~14 days using a study issued mobile phone. Participants also responded to randomly timed assessments. During both types of assessments, participants indicated their current level of affect. By anchoring off snacking events, the trajectory of affect in the hours leading up to - and following - snacking was explored.

RESULTS
In the three hours leading up to a healthy snack, affect was stable. In contrast, affect fell during the hours leading up to an unhealthy snack. The interaction between snack type and time was significant. A similar, but opposite, pattern was seen following snacking: where affect decreased after unhealthy snacking, affect increased following healthy snack intake.

CONCLUSION
The findings are consistent with the hypothesis of comfort eating, with unhealthy snacking being preceded by worsening affect. Unhealthy snacking did not, however, lead to affect improvements afterwards, which questions the 'effectiveness' of comfort eating. The intake of healthy snacks however was associated with positive affective experiences. These findings could function as a component of interventions aiming at improving dietary behaviours.

Reasons for eating 'unhealthy' snacks in overweight and obese males and females.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Hunger, temptation, and emotional eating are the main reasons for eating unhealthy snacks in overweight and obese individuals.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Snack foods are often high in fat and sugar. Thus, reducing snack consumption may be a useful weight management strategy. However, individuals may snack for a variety of reasons with different implications for intervention. The present study examined the perceived reasons for eating main meals, 'unhealthy' snacks (i.e. snacks high in fat or sugar) and 'healthy' snacks in overweight and obese participants.

METHODS
Over a period of 5 days, 28 males and 27 females completed a food diary every time they ate. As well as providing details about the type of eating episode and food eaten, they also rated their agreement with 13 different reasons for eating (identified from relevant literature and a pilot study).

RESULTS
Across a total of 1084 eating episodes, 358 were coded as snacks, 79% of which were high in either fat or sugar. The results showed that hunger and temptation (external eating) were reported as a reason for eating unhealthy snacks in 49% and 55% of all episodes, respectively. Eating because the individual was feeling fed up, bored or stressed (emotional eating) was given as a reason in 26% of episodes.

CONCLUSIONS
These findings point to the potential utility of intervention strategies that target cravings, enhance self-control or promote stimulus control.

Ultra-Processed Foods and Mental Health: Where Do Eating Disorders Fit into the Puzzle?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Ultra-processed foods may contribute to poorer mental health, particularly depression, and ultra-processed food addiction (UPFA) may be a new clinical phenotype.

Abstract:Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) like pastries, packaged snacks, fast foods, and sweetened beverages have become dominant in the modern food supply and are strongly associated with numerous public health concerns. While the physical health consequences of UPF intake have been well documented (e.g., increased risks of cardiometabolic conditions), less empirical discussion has emphasized the mental health consequences of chronic UPF consumption. Notably, the unique characteristics of UPFs (e.g., artificially high levels of reinforcing ingredients) influence biological processes (e.g., dopamine signaling) in a manner that may contribute to poorer psychological functioning for some individuals. Importantly, gold-standard behavioral lifestyle interventions and treatments specifically for disordered eating do not acknowledge the direct role that UPFs may play in sensitizing reward-related neural functioning, disrupting metabolic responses, and motivating subsequent UPF cravings and intake. The lack of consideration for the influences of UPFs on mental health is particularly problematic given the growing scientific support for the addictive properties of these foods and the utility of ultra-processed food addiction (UPFA) as a novel clinical phenotype endorsed by 14–20% of individuals across international samples. The overarching aim of the present review is to summarize the science of how UPFs may affect mental health, emphasizing contributing biological mechanisms. Specifically, the authors will (1) describe how corporate-sponsored research and financial agendas have contributed to contention and debate about the role of UPFs in health; (2) define UPFs and their nutritional characteristics; (3) review observed associations between UPF intake and mental health conditions, especially with depression; (4) outline the evidence for UPFA; and (5) describe nuanced treatment considerations for comorbid UPFA and eating disorders.

Frequency of fruit consumption and savoury snacking predict psychological health; selective mediation via cognitive failures

Number of 

Key takeaways:Frequent fruit consumption reduces depression and anxiety, while savoury snacking increases anxiety, with cognitive failures acting as a mediator.

Abstract:Abstract While there is growing interest in the link between diet and psychological health, there is a surprising lack of studies investigating the precise associations between nutrient-rich foods (such as fruit and vegetables) v. nutrient-poor foods (such as energy-dense savoury and sweet snacks), and psychological health. Similarly, the psychological processes underpinning the relationship between dietary intake and psychological health remain unclear. Hence, the present study aimed to explore the relationship between dietary consumption and psychological health, with cognitive processes as a theoretical mediator. This cross-sectional online study included 428 healthy adults (53 % female; mean age = 39·7 years, sd = 13·0), with participants completing a range of validated questionnaires measuring dietary habits and psychological health. Stepwise multiple regression revealed that more frequent consumption of fruit was associated with reduced symptoms of depression (β = –0·109, P = 0·025) and greater positive psychological wellbeing (β = 0·187, P < 0·001). Conversely, more frequent savoury snacking was associated with increased anxiety (β = 0·127, P = 0·005). Further, mediation analyses revealed that more frequent consumption of savoury snacks was associated with increased symptoms of depression, stress, anxiety and reduced psychological wellbeing, via an increase in cognitive failures (ps < 0·001). These results provide new insights on the independent associations between certain types of food and psychological health, and the psychological mechanisms that may mediate these. Further work is now required to establish causality and determine whether these may represent modifiable dietary targets that can directly (and indirectly) influence our psychological health.

A STUDY ON ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DIETARY EATING HABITS AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG MEDICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS OF WESTERN CITY OF GUJARAT

Number of 

Key takeaways:Frequent consumption of canned, frozen, and fast foods is associated with depression, while anxiety is linked to fried foods, current smokers, and alcohol users.

Abstract:Background: Medical students are perceived to have high levels of stress throughout their undergraduate and the consumption of snacks and fast food is more common among medical students because it's more convenient. due to the paucity of research data, many people are unaware that Dietary practices have an important role in shaping our mental health. This study was done to assess the association between dietary eating and mental health among medical undergraduate students Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 medical college students studying in a government medical college selected by random sampling method. Data was collected using a structured, validated questionnaire to assess the dietary eating habits and assess the various factors of mental health, i.e., stress, depression and anxiety, using Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21). Results: It was found that 41% were having a craving for junk food and frequent consumption of canned foods, frozen foods and fast foods were risk factors for depression. Anxiety was found to be associated with frequent fried foods consumption, current smoker and alcohol consuming students. Conclusion: This study concludes that students and their mental health are affected signicantly by their dietary habits and the food habits of students should be monitored and interventions, if necessary, should be given. More research is necessary to establish causal relationships

Mental health problems in relation to eating behavior patterns, nutrient intakes and health related quality of life among Iranian female adolescents

Number of 

Key takeaways:Unhealthy eating patterns like snacking and meal skipping are associated with emotional disorders, while low fat eating patterns are associated with reduced hyperactivity disorders in Iranian female adolescents.

Abstract:Aims To identify the association between mental health problems, eating behavior patterns, nutrient intakes and health related quality of life (HRQoL) among Iranian female adolescents. Materials and methods The current cross-sectional study conducted among three high-schools randomly selected from 10-day-public high schools in the selected sub-county from Tabriz city-Iran between December 2015 through March 2016. Participants were a sample of 107 adolescent girls aged 15–17 years old. Anthropometric parameters were measured and assessments of HRQoL, mental health problems and eating behavioral patterns were performed by Short Form 36 (SF-36), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) and Eating Behavioral Pattern Questionnaire (EBPQ) respectively. Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative Food-Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) adapted for the Iranian society. Quality of life was measured with HRQoL questionnaire. Quantitative analysis using independent sample t test was performed for comparison of continuous variables between two subgroups (unlikely, possible/probable) of each category of mental health problem. Multiple logistic regression was used to measure the potential predictors (e.g. eating patterns and HRQoL) of mental health problems in two models of crude and adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI). P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results Indicators of conduct problems and hyperactivity disorders were the most prevalent mental health problems among female adolescents (25.2% and 18.6% respectively). The prevalence of hyperactivity disorders among female adolescents was 35.5%. Female adolescents in high scores of ‘snacking and convenience’, ‘planning ahead’ and ‘meal skipping’ eating patterns were more likely to have indicators of emotional disorders (P < 0.05). Also, being in the high tertile of ‘low fat eating’ pattern made adolescents less likely to have hyperactivity disorders (P < 0.05). Moreover, according to our finding, high scores of vitality and mental health components of HRQoL were associated with reduced likelihood of emotional disorders, conduct disorders and hyperactivity disorders. No significant difference in terms of BMI and nutrient intakes in different categories of mental health problems according to SDQ scoring was identified. Conclusions In the current study unhealthy eating patterns including ‘snacking and convenience’, ‘planning ahead’ and ‘meal skipping’ eating patterns were positive predictors of “emotional disorders” while “low fat” eating pattern was negative predictor of hyperactivity disorders.

Poor Mental Health Is Related to Excess Weight via Lifestyle: A Cross-Sectional Gender- and Age-Dependent Mediation Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Poor mental health is linked to an unhealthier lifestyle, with associations varying by gender and age, and lifestyle factors like disordered eating, physical activity, and smoking acting as significant mediators.

Abstract:Within mental health as risk factor for excess weight, prevention-relevant questions remain: does the relation persist after considering lifestyle, which lifestyle parameters might be most important to target, which gender or age subgroups are most at risk? The cross-sectional Belgian health survey 2013 (n = 4687; ≥15 years) measured mental health via anxiety and depression symptoms (Symptom Check List 90-R) and distress (General Health Questionnaire-12). Logistic regression, multiple mediation and moderated mediation were applied. Poor mental health was significantly related to a higher excess weight prevalence (odds ratio (OR) = 1.18 with 95% confidence interval (0.17–1.19)) and an unhealthier lifestyle i.e., more smoking, sleep problems, disordered eating, soft-drink, and alcohol consumption; while less fruit/vegetables and physical activity and even lower snack intake. Associations were often gender- and age-specific e.g., poor mental health was only related to less snacking in men and middle-adulthood, while an association with more snacking appeared in youth (<25 years). Disordered eating, physical activity and smoking were significant mediators explaining 88% of mental-weight associations, after which the association became negative (OR = 0.92 (0.91–0.93)). Mediation by snacking and disordered eating was stronger in the youngest and mediation by smoking was stronger in women. Thus, especially youth has high mental health associated behavioral and weight risks and gender or age differences can explain conflicting literature results on lifestyle.

Disordered Eating Attitudes, Demographics, and Snack Patterns in Overweight and Obese US College Students

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher stress levels in college students are associated with increased disordered eating attitudes, suggesting the need for stress management interventions and awareness programs.

Abstract:An unhealthy snack pattern may impact a person's overall health and quality of life. College students are at risk for disordered eating attitudes (DEA) due the elevated mental and physical demands of higher education. This could lead to a greater snack intake that could replace meals. DEA could also be influenced by demographics. Our objective was to evaluate the association between DEA, snack patterns, stress level, and demographics.
 
 
 
 We analyzed the baseline data from the Snackability Trial, a trial among overweight and obese students from US colleges to test the effects of using the Snackability app to choose healthier snacks compared to controls (no access to the app). Students are being recruited using flyers sent via email by college professors/staff and social media since June 2020. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (before randomization) on demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, income), snack eating patterns, stress level (scale from 1–10 with 10 being the most stressed), and DEA Score (a validated score assessing eating attitudes with 25 questions related to perceptions of food; higher DEA scores indicate higher DEA with the minimum possible score of 37 and maximum of 190). Descriptive statistics included frequency and mean/standard deviation of all variables. ANOVA and Pearson Correlations were used to evaluate the associations between variables.
 
 
 
 A total of 135 have completed thus far all baseline questionnaires. The average age was 21.5 ± 2.01 years, most students were female (83.7%), Hispanic/Latino (52.6%), and with a household income of <$50,000 (60.0%). Average DEAS was 90.4 ± 19.1, daily snack intake was 2.33 ± 1.08, and stress score was 6.78 ± 1.97. DEAS score was not associated with demographic variables or snack intake, but there was a significant correlation between DEAS and stress level (r = 0.3; P < 0.001).
 
 
 
 Students who have a higher level of stress are more likely to have DEA. Disordered eating is an umbrella of irregular eating behaviors that may or may not warrant a diagnosis of a specific eating disorder. Based on these findings, universities may need to develop interventions for college students to manage stress as well as promoting awareness and programs for students with high levels of disordered eating.

Emotional Determinants of Snack Consumption by Polish Consumers

Number of 

Key takeaways:Emotional eating patterns significantly influence snack consumption, leading to unhealthy snack choices and poorer health and financial profiles among Polish consumers.

Abstract:Abstract Emotions are the effect but also the cause of eating behaviors, including the purchase and consumption of snacks. As snacks become an increasingly prevalent segment of the food industry, their consumption has been linked to rising rates of overweight, obesity, and diet-related diseases. Understanding how emotional valence influences consumer attitudes and behaviors toward snacks is therefore crucial. This study explores the relationship between emotional eating and the propensity to consume unhealthy snacks, both sweet and salty. A survey of 707 representative participants revealed distinct emotional patterns in snack consumption, with choices significantly influenced by consumers' emotional states and personal preferences. Furthermore, individuals who frequently opted for unhealthy snacks typically exhibited poorer health and financial profiles.

College Students and Eating Habits: A Study Using An Ecological Model for Healthy Behavior

Number of 

Key takeaways:Barriers to healthy eating among college students include time constraints, unhealthy snacking, stress, high prices of healthy food, and easy access to junk food, while enablers include improved food knowledge, meal planning, involvement in food preparation, and being physically active.

Abstract:Overweightness and obesity rates have increased dramatically over the past few decades and they represent a health epidemic in the United States (US). Unhealthy dietary habits are among the factors that can have adverse effects on weight status in young adulthood. The purpose of this explorative study was to use a qualitative research design to analyze the factors (barriers and enablers) that US college students perceived as influencing healthy eating behaviors. A group of Cornell University students (n = 35) participated in six semi-structured focus groups. A qualitative software, CAQDAS Nvivo11 Plus, was used to create codes that categorized the group discussions while using an Ecological Model. Common barriers to healthy eating were time constraints, unhealthy snacking, convenience high-calorie food, stress, high prices of healthy food, and easy access to junk food. Conversely, enablers to healthy behavior were improved food knowledge and education, meal planning, involvement in food preparation, and being physically active. Parental food behavior and friends’ social pressure were considered to have both positive and negative influences on individual eating habits. The study highlighted the importance of consulting college students when developing healthy eating interventions across the campus (e.g., labeling healthy food options and information campaigns) and considering individual-level factors and socio-ecological aspects in the analysis.

Distal and Proximal Predictors of Snacking at Work: A Daily-Survey Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Organizational eating climate and self-control demands at work influence employees' food choices, with health motives leading to healthier snacks and affect regulation motives leading to more sweet snacks.

Abstract:This study aimed at examining predictors of healthy and unhealthy snacking at work. As proximal predictors we looked at food-choice motives (health motive, affect-regulation motive); as distal predictors we included organizational eating climate, emotional eating, and self-control demands at work. We collected daily survey data from 247 employees, over a period of 2 workweeks. Multilevel structural equation modeling showed that organizational eating climate predicted health as food-choice motive, whereas emotional eating and self-control demands predicted affect regulation as food-choice motive. The health motive, in turn, predicted consuming more fruits and more cereal bars and less sweet snacks; the affect-regulation motive predicted consuming more sweet snacks. Findings highlight the importance of a health-promoting eating climate within the organization and point to the potential harm of high self-control demands at work.

Unhealthy eating and academic stress: The moderating effect of eating style and BMI

Number of 

Key takeaways:Academic stress increases unhealthy food consumption in Italian students, reduces junk food consumption in French students, with negative emotional eating and BMI moderating the impact of stress on sweet and snacking habits.

Abstract:This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between stress and unhealthy eating among undergraduate students, considering the moderation effects of BMI, eating style, and nationality. A total of 748 Italian and French students completed self-report measures of academic stress, emotional eating, restrained eating, BMI, and unhealthy eating intake. Results showed that academic stress increased unhealthy food consumption in Italian students, whereas it reduced junk food consumption in French students. Negative emotional eating and BMI moderated, respectively, the impact of academic stress on sweet food intake and snacking. Finally, no clear support was found for the moderation role of restrained eating.

Snacking motivations and behaviour in Australian adults: The role of personality traits

Number of 

Key takeaways:Health motivation for snacking reduces unhealthy snack choices and consumption, with personality traits like openness and conscientiousness playing a role in this relationship.

Abstract:Snacking, namely, consuming food and beverages in-between main meals, especially snacks with a high fat, salt and/or sugar content, is a major contributor to excessive energy intake and long-term weight gain(1). There are many potential drivers of snacking behaviours, including physiological (e.g., hunger) as well as social, psychological, and emotional reasons(2). Individual differences, such as personality traits, have been linked to unhealthy snacking. Nevertheless, it is important to examine the potential explanatory pathways, such as motivations for snacking and habit strength, that may explain this relationship between personality and snacking. This cross-sectional study investigated the associations between personality traits, habit strength, motivations for snacking, and snacking behaviour, including choice and consumption. Participants were n = 230 Australian adults (female: n = 164; 71.3%) aged 18-77 years old (M = 34 years, SD = 13.4) who completed an online survey. The survey included assessments of personality traits (The Big Five Inventory 2), habit strength (the Self-Report Habit Index), motivations for snacking (The Eating Motivation Survey), momentary snack food choice (Snack Preference Task), and habitual snack food consumption (Snack Frequency Questionnaire). Overall, the most frequently selected motivations for snacking were ‘liking’, ‘convenience’, and ‘habit’. Correlation analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between motivations for snacking and snacking behaviour. We found that health motivation for snacking was negatively correlated with momentary choice (r = -.042, p <.01) and habitual consumption (r = -.033, p <.01) of unhealthy snack foods and beverages. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine whether habit strength and the Big Five personality traits predicted both motivations for snacking and snacking behaviours after controlling for demographic variables. For health motivations for snacking, habit strength (beta = −0.15, p = .025), openness (beta = 0.50, p = .003, and conscientiousness (beta = 0.58, p = .001) were significant predictors. For momentary choice of unhealthy snacks, health motivation (beta = −4.35, p = .004), pleasure (beta = 3.53, p = .029), and visual appeal (beta = 5.29, p <.001) were significant predictors. For habitual consumption of unhealthy snacks, health motivation (beta = −5.39, p = .001), habit strength (beta = 2.89, p = .045) and neuroticism (beta = 5.16, p = .045) were significant predictors. These findings indicate that health motivation for snacking predicts both momentary snack preference and habitual snack food consumption. Moreover, personality traits may be linked with habitual unhealthy snacking behaviour via their association with specific motivations for snacking. Overall, these findings suggest that health promotion messages focusing on health motivation may be important for increasing healthier momentary and habitual snack choices to improve dietary intake and support weight management.

The cross-sectional association between snacking behaviour and measures of adiposity: the Fenland Study, UK

Number of 

Key takeaways:Snacking frequency may be associated with higher or lower adiposity, with the direction of association varying by BMI status and snack food choice.

Abstract:Abstract Unhealthy dietary behaviours may contribute to obesity along with energy imbalance. Both positive and null associations of snacking and BMI have been reported, but the association between snacking and total adiposity or pattern of fat deposition remains unevaluated. The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between snacking frequency and detailed adiposity measurements. A total of 10 092 adults residing in Cambridgeshire, England, self-completed eating pattern snacking frequency, FFQ and physical activity questionnaires. Measurements included anthropometry, body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and ultrasound and assessment of physical activity energy expenditure using heart rate and movement sensing. Linear regression analyses were conducted adjusted for age, socio-demographics, dietary quality, energy intake, PAEE and screen time by sex and BMI status. Among normal-weight individuals (BMI<25 kg/m2), each additional snack was inversely associated with obesity measures: lower total body fat in men and women (−0·41 (95 % CI −0·74, −0·07) %, −0·41 (−0·67, −0·15) %, respectively) and waist circumference (−0·52 (−0·90, −0·14) cm) in men. In contrast, among the overweight/obese (BMI≥25 kg/m2), there were positive associations: higher waist circumference (0·80 (0·34, 0·28) cm) and subcutaneous fat (0·06 (0·01, 0·110) cm) in women and waist circumference (0·37 (0·00, 0·73) cm) in men. Comparing intakes of snack-type foods showed that participants with BMI≥25 kg/m2 had higher intakes of crisps, sweets, chocolates and ice-creams and lower intakes of yoghurt and nuts compared with normal-weight participants. Adjusting for these foods in a model that included a BMI–snacking interaction term attenuated all the associations to null. Snacking frequency may be associated with higher or lower adiposity, with the direction of association being differential by BMI status and dependent on snack food choice. Improving snack choices could contribute to anti-obesity public health interventions.

Effects of nocturnal snacks on body composition in patients with liver cirrhosis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Nocturnal snacks may improve body composition indices in patients with liver cirrhosis, but have minor effects on skeletal muscle mass.

Abstract:BACKGROUND Patients with liver cirrhosis are universally malnourished and the nocturnal snacks intervention is the currently recommended nutritional intervention for patients with liver cirrhosis. Body composition is an important indicator for the assessment of nutritional conditions. We investigated the effects of nocturnal snacks (200 kcal/day) for 3 months on body composition in patients with liver cirrhosis. AIM To investigate the effect of nocturnal snacks on body composition in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS Seventy patients with liver cirrhosis and 30 healthy controls were enrolled, and differences in body composition were detected using InBody 720, a body composition analyzer. The patients were further randomized into a normal diet group (three meals a day) and nocturnal snacks group (three meals a day + nocturnal snacks). The effect of nocturnal snacks on the body composition of patients with cirrhosis was assessed after 3 months of intervention. RESULTS Body fat mass (BFM), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), fat free mass, visceral fat area (VFA), and body cell mass (BCM) were significantly lower in the liver cirrhosis patients than in the healthy controls. After 3 months’ intervention, BFM, VFA and BCM were significantly higher in the nocturnal snacks group than in the normal diet group, with no significant differences in total caloric intake and daily activity. However, there was no significant difference in SMM between the nocturnal snacks and normal diet groups. CONCLUSION Long-term nocturnal snacks may improve body composition indices such as BFM, VFA and BCM in patients with cirrhosis. However, the improvement was minor for SMM.

Effects of 6 Months of Soy-Enriched High Protein Compared to Eucaloric Low Protein Snack Replacement on Appetite, Dietary Intake, and Body Composition in Normal-Weight Obese Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:Six months of soy-enriched high protein snack replacement decreased appetite and improved body composition in women with normal-weight obesity compared to isocaloric low protein snacks.

Abstract:(1) Background: The favorable effects of high protein snacks on body composition and appetite status in lean and athletic populations have been illustrated previously. However, the effects of soy-enriched high protein snacks have not been investigated in women with normal-weight obesity (NWO). Consequently, we aimed at comparing the effects of six months of soy-enriched high protein snack replacement on appetite, body composition, and dietary intake in women with NWO. (2) Methods: One hundred seven (107) women with NWO who were assigned to one of two groups; high protein snack (HP, n = 52) containing 50 g soybean or isocaloric low-protein snack (protein: 18.2 g, carbohydrate: 15 g, fat: 10 g, energy: 210 kcal) or isocaloric low protein snack (LP, n = 55) containing 3.5 servings of fruit (protein: <2 g, carbohydrate: ≈50 g, fat: <1 g, energy: ≈210 kcal) as part of their daily meals (as a snack at 10 a.m.), successfully completed the study interventions. Body mass (BM), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), BFP, skeletal muscle mass, dietary intake, and appetite levels were evaluated prior to and after the six-month intervention. (3) Results: Appetite (HP = −12 mm and LP = −0.6 mm), energy intake (HP = −166.2 kcal/day and LP = 91.3 kcal), carbohydrate intake (HP = −58.4 g/day and LP = 6.4 g/day), WC (HP = −4.3 cm and LP = −0.9 cm), and BFP (HP = −3.7% and LP = −0.9%) were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced, while skeletal muscle mass (HP = 1.2 kg and LP = 0.3 kg) significantly increased in the HP compared to the LP group, respectively. (4) Conclusions: Six months of a soy-enriched high protein snack replacement decreased appetite and improved body composition in women with NWO. Our findings suggest that soy-enriched high protein snacks are an efficacious strategy for body composition improvement.

Chronotype Differences in Body Composition, Dietary Intake and Eating Behavior Outcomes: A Scoping Systematic Review

Number of 

Key takeaways:Late evening chronotypes are more likely to be overweight/obese with poorer metabolic health, due to unhealthy eating behaviors and unfavorable dietary intakes.

Abstract:ABSTRACT The timing and nutritional composition of food intake are important zeitgebers for the biological clocks in humans. Thus, eating at an inappropriate time (e.g., during the night) may have a desynchronizing effect on the biological clocks and, in the long term, may result in adverse health outcomes (e.g., weight gain, obesity, and poor metabolic function). Being a very late or early chronotype not only determines preferred sleep and wake times but may also influence subsequent mealtimes, which may affect the circadian timing system. In recent years, an increased number of studies have examined the relation between chronotype and health outcomes, with a main focus on absolute food intake and metabolic markers and, to a lesser extent, on dietary intake distribution and eating behavior. Therefore, this review aimed to systematically determine whether chronotype indirectly affects eating behaviors, dietary intake (timing, choice, nutrients), and biomarkers leading to body composition outcomes in healthy adults. A systematic literature search on electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane library) was performed (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews number: CRD42020219754). Only studies that included healthy adults (aged >18 y), classified according to chronotype and body composition profiles, using outcomes of dietary intake, eating behavior, and/or biomarkers, were considered. Of 4404 articles, 24 met the inclusion criteria. The results revealed that late compared with early chronotypes were more likely to be overweight/obese with poorer metabolic health. Both MT and ET had similar energy and macronutrient intakes, consuming food during their preferred sleep–wake timing: later for ET than MT. Most of the energy and macronutrient intakes were distributed toward nighttime for ET and exacerbated by unhealthy eating behaviors and unfavorable dietary intakes. These findings from our systematic review give further insight why higher rates of overweight/obesity and unhealthier metabolic biomarkers are more likely to occur in ET.

Effects of breaking up prolonged sitting via exercise snacks intervention on the body composition and plasma metabolomics of sedentary obese adults: a randomized controlled trial

Number of 

Key takeaways:Exercise snacks, such as sprint exercises or stair-climbing, effectively reduce abdominal visceral and epicardial fat in sedentary obese adults, potentially due to altered pathways of isoleucine, glycine, and serine metabolism.

Abstract:Obesity resulting from long-term sedentary a significant threat to human health. This study explores the effects of exercise snack intervention on body composition and plasma metabolomics in sedentary obese adults. Participants in the snack group were subjected to 4 days of sprint exercises by stair-climbing per week for 12 weeks. Systemic and regional fat mass, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), abdominal visceral (AVFA) and subcutaneous (ASFA) fat area and plasma metabolomics data were measured before and after intervention. A higher improvement of EAT, AVFA and ASFA in the snack group compared to that in the control group, with a significant interaction effect (p < 0.05). The key differential metabolites between the two groups include isoleucine, glycine and serine. The proposed exercise snack effectively reduced the amount of AVFA and EAT. The change in body composition may be associated with the altered pathways of isoleucine, glycine, and serine metabolism.

Nutritional status, body composition and diet quality in children with cancer

Number of 

Key takeaways:Children with cancer experience changes in body composition and eating habits during cancer treatment, affecting their quality of life and drug metabolism.

Abstract:During cancer treatment, nutritional status disorders such as malnutrition or obesity affect the tolerance of cancer treatment, quality of life, but also the pharmacokinetics of drugs. It is hypothesized that changes in fat and lean body mass can modify chemotherapy volume distribution, metabolism and clearance. In children with cancer, lean body mass decreases or remains low during treatment and fat mass increases. Body composition is influenced by the cancer itself, aggressive multimodal-therapies, changes in metabolism, unbalanced diet and reduced physical activity. Due to the side effects of treatment, including changes in the sense of taste and smell, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stress, eating according to recommendation for macronutrients and micronutrients is difficult. Research indicates that throughout cancer treatment, the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products tends to be insufficient, whereas there is an elevated intake of sugar and unhealthy snacks. Children exhibit a preference for high-carbohydrate, salty, and strongly flavored products. This review revealed the importance of body composition and its changes during cancer treatment in children, as well as eating habits and diet quality.

Impact of the Intake of Snacks and Lifestyle Behaviors on Obesity among University Students Living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia

Number of 

Key takeaways:Obese university students in Saudi Arabia eat more unhealthy snacks, while non-obese students eat more healthy snacks, suggesting that providing healthy snacks and health education programs can help reduce obesity among students.

Abstract:Unhealthy eating habits increase the risk of obesity. This study investigated the association between obesity and the intake of snacks and lifestyle behaviors among university students in Saudi Arabia. The study included 662 students aged 18–29 years, studying at King Abdulaziz University. An online survey collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, height, and weight, to calculate body mass index (BMI), lifestyle behaviors, dietary habits, and snack intake. The prevalence of overweight and obese students was 18.6% and 12.7%, respectively. Sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviors had insignificant effects on obesity. Obese students consumed two meals daily and more cereals during breakfast. Non-obese students consumed more beverages at breakfast and had their daily meals with their families. The frequency of intake of snacks had an insignificant effect on obesity. However, obese students had a significantly higher intake of potato chips, popcorn, and biscuits, while non-obese students had a significantly higher intake of salads compared with obese students. Students consumed significantly less fruit and vegetables, chocolate, biscuits, nuts, and dairy products as snacks when inside the university compared to outside. To reduce obesity among students, universities should ensure access to healthy snacks, and provide health education programs to encourage healthy eating habits and lifestyles.

Relationship Between Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Body Composition Parameters in Older Adults from the Mediterranean Region

Number of 

Key takeaways:Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with improved body composition in older adults, but the overall health effects of the diet remain unclear.

Abstract:In recent decades, the rapid spread of various communication media has led to changes in traditional eating habits. In the Mediterranean region, the classic (Mediterranean) dietary pattern has been lost as a result. This has led to a shift in eating habits towards unhealthy eating patterns, which in turn has resulted in an inadequate distribution of body composition. It is known that, among other things, the number of non-communicable diseases increases with the inadequate distribution of body composition. The aim of our study was to examine the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) of older adults in the Mediterranean region in relation to specific body composition parameters. This study included 521 older adults with a mean age of 69.6 ± 6.3 years. Body composition was measured using the BIA 101 Anniversary device (Akern s.r.l., Florence, Italy) and adherence to the MD was assessed using the MEDLIFE index questionnaire. This study found significant differences in body composition between males and females. The mean adherence to the MD was 17.0 ± 3.3 points among the participants and there was higher adherence in females (p = 0.002, ηp2 = 0.019). A multiple linear regression was performed to assess the relationship between the body composition parameters and MD. Multiple linear regression models were significant for reactance, fat mass (%), fat-free mass (%), skeletal muscle index, and total body water (%), with specific individual MEDLIFE items such as the consumption of processed meat, meat, white meat, fruit, vegetables, olive oil and limiting snacks between meals. Moreover, promising correlations were found between certain MD characteristics and BIA parameters, but the overall health effects of the MD remain unclear.

The impact of food-related behaviours and emotional functioning on body mass index in an adult sample

Number of 

Key takeaways:Food-related behaviors and emotional functioning are significantly related to body mass index in adults, with emotional eating indirectly increasing BMI through snacking.

Abstract:Abstract Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of food-related behaviours (emotional eating, snacking) and emotional functioning (negative emotions, stress, emotional dysregulation) on body mass index in an adult sample. Direct and indirect relationships of the above-mentioned variables were examined. Methods The total sample comprised 298 adults. All participants completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Feeling of Stress Questionnaire and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. Results Our findings showed that food-related behaviours and emotional functioning are related to body mass index in adults. In addition, emotional dysregulation and negative emotions did not have direct impact on snacking. Moreover, snacking did not have a direct impact on body mass index. However, snacking had an indirect effect on body mass index (through emotional eating). The other relationships were significant and consistent with the hypothesised positive direction. Conclusion We found significant relationships among (almost all) food-related behaviours, emotional functioning and body mass index in adults. However, future research on pathways from negative emotions/emotional dysregulation to snacking and from snacking to BMI should be conducted. Level of evidence Level V, descriptive study.

Effects of time-restricted eating with exercise on body composition in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Key takeaways:Time-restricted eating with exercise may reduce fat mass compared to unrestricted eating while preserving fat-free mass in adults.

Association between Emotional Eating and Frequency of Unhealthy Food Consumption among Taiwanese Adolescents

Number of 

Key takeaways:Emotional eating in adolescents is associated with increased consumption of unhealthy foods, with males consuming more unhealthy foods than females.

Abstract:Emotional eating is one factor that increases the consumption of unhealthy food. This study aimed to investigate the association between emotional eating and frequencies of consuming fast food, high-fat snacks, processed meat products, dessert foods, and sugar-sweetened beverages , those exhibiting emotional eating were more likely to consume fast food (Odds ratio (OR) = 2.40, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 2.18–2.64), high-fat snacks (OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 2.12–2.49), processed meat products (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.78–2.08), dessert foods (OR = 2.49, 95% CI: 2.31–2.69), and sugar-sweetened beverages (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.70–1.98). Factors that were positively associated with unhealthy food consumption included eating while doing other activities, binge drinking, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle. Among all the covariates, nutrition label reading was the only factor that was inversely associated with frequent unhealthy food consumption. Sex and school type may moderate the effect of emotional eating on the frequent consumption of specific unhealthy food groups. In conclusion, adolescents with high emotional eating were more likely to report frequent consumption of unhealthy foods in Taiwan. Our findings showed that male participants appeared to consume fast foods, high-fat snacks, processed meat, and SSBs more often and dessert foods less often than females. Future longitudinal studies are recommended for understanding the causal relationship between emotional eating and unhealthy food consumption.
