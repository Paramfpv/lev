Harmfulness of excessive trans fat consumption for health and longevity

Excessive consumption of trans fats is one of the key risk factors for many chronic metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Its presence in the diet contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and many other metabolic disorders, which translates to a shortened lifespan and reduced quality of life.

Level of evidence:Strong

Trans fats negatively affect the body by raising levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol and lowering "good" HDL cholesterol, increasing inflammation and oxidative stress, and impairing endothelial function. Additionally, they worsen insulin resistance, cause gut dysbiosis, activate genes responsible for lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis in the liver, which leads to the development of metabolic diseases and accelerates atherosclerotic processes and organ damage.

The harmfulness of excessive trans fat consumption is confirmed by numerous epidemiological, experimental, and clinical studies. Trans fats significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and liver diseases. Even moderate exposure is associated with a significant health threat and shortened lifespan.

The problem of excessive trans fat consumption is global and affects millions of people around the world. It is estimated that trans fats contribute to a significant number of deaths related to heart disease and chronic metabolic diseases.

Limit consumption of processed foods and fast foods

Avoid products containing hydrogenated vegetable oils and industrial margarines, which are the main sources of trans fats.

Check product ingredients and avoid those with 'partially hydrogenated oils' or a high trans fat content.

Choose natural sources of fats

Opt for healthy fats from nuts, olive oil, avocado, and fatty fish.

Promote regulations limiting trans fats

Support political and social initiatives aimed at eliminating trans fats from food products.

Cardiovascular system

Excessive trans fat consumption has a clearly negative impact on the cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and cardiovascular mortality. This effect is mainly due to worsening lipid profiles, increased inflammation, and endothelial damage.

Mechanisms of harmful trans fat action

Health and epidemiological effects

Excessive trans fat consumption has a strongly negative impact on liver health. A diet rich in trans fats promotes the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), increases inflammation, oxidative stress, and may lead to more serious damage such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or even liver cancer.

Mechanisms of liver damage

Excessive trans fat consumption has a clearly negative impact on metabolism. Even small amounts of trans fats in the diet can lead to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, abnormal lipid profile, weight gain, and an increased risk of metabolic syndrome.

Final comment:There is an extensive and consistent scientific literature, including numerous meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and high-quality observational studies, which clearly confirm the negative impact of excessive trans fat consumption on human health. Evidence shows that trans fats increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and have a negative effect on the lipid profile, causing inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. These effects have been confirmed in both human and animal studies, and reducing trans fat intake results in improved health indicators in the population. In light of these data, trans fat consumption is a significant risk factor for chronic diseases and should be eliminated from the diet.

Key takeaways:Ruminant trans fats may have a cardioprotective role in the heart, while industrial trans fats are associated with cardiovascular complications, including atherosclerosis.

Abstract:Coronary heart disease is becoming a worldwide epidemic and diet and lifestyle are well known contributing factors. Identifying the kinds of foods that may have a cardioprotective or cardiotoxic effect and understanding their molecular mechanisms of action has become of increasing importance. Through largely epidemiological evidence, trans fatty acid (TFA) intake has been associated with a variety of cardiovascular complications including atherosclerosis. Traditionally, industrial TFAs (iTFAs) have been associated with these deleterious cardiovascular effects. However, there is a current body of research that suggests that ruminant trans fats (rTFAs) may have a cardioprotective role within the heart. The molecular mechanisms whereby TFAs are delivering their effects are largely unknown. In the following review, we discuss recent in vitro, animal and epidemiological research to better understand the effect of TFAs in the diet on cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis.

Intake of saturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids and risk of all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies

Number of 

Key takeaways:Saturated fat intake is not consistently associated with increased risk of all cause mortality, CVD, CHD, ischemic stroke, or type 2 diabetes, while trans fat intake is associated with increased risk of all cause mortality, CHD, and type 2 diabetes.

Abstract:Objective To systematically review associations between intake of saturated fat and trans unsaturated fat and all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated mortality, coronary heart disease (CHD) and associated mortality, ischemic stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, and CINAHL from inception to 1 May 2015, supplemented by bibliographies of retrieved articles and previous reviews. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Observational studies reporting associations of saturated fat and/or trans unsaturated fat (total, industrially manufactured, or from ruminant animals) with all cause mortality, CHD/CVD mortality, total CHD, ischemic stroke, or type 2 diabetes. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study risks of bias. Multivariable relative risks were pooled. Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified. Potential publication bias was assessed and subgroup analyses were undertaken. The GRADE approach was used to evaluate quality of evidence and certainty of conclusions. Results For saturated fat, three to 12 prospective cohort studies for each association were pooled (five to 17 comparisons with 90 501-339 090 participants). Saturated fat intake was not associated with all cause mortality (relative risk 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.09), CVD mortality (0.97, 0.84 to 1.12), total CHD (1.06, 0.95 to 1.17), ischemic stroke (1.02, 0.90 to 1.15), or type 2 diabetes (0.95, 0.88 to 1.03). There was no convincing lack of association between saturated fat and CHD mortality (1.15, 0.97 to 1.36; P=0.10). For trans fats, one to six prospective cohort studies for each association were pooled (two to seven comparisons with 12 942-230 135 participants). Total trans fat intake was associated with all cause mortality (1.34, 1.16 to 1.56), CHD mortality (1.28, 1.09 to 1.50), and total CHD (1.21, 1.10 to 1.33) but not ischemic stroke (1.07, 0.88 to 1.28) or type 2 diabetes (1.10, 0.95 to 1.27). Industrial, but not ruminant, trans fats were associated with CHD mortality (1.18 (1.04 to 1.33) v 1.01 (0.71 to 1.43)) and CHD (1.42 (1.05 to 1.92) v 0.93 (0.73 to 1.18)). Ruminant trans-palmitoleic acid was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes (0.58, 0.46 to 0.74). The certainty of associations between saturated fat and all outcomes was “very low.” The certainty of associations of trans fat with CHD outcomes was “moderate” and “very low” to “low” for other associations. Conclusions Saturated fats are not associated with all cause mortality, CVD, CHD, ischemic stroke, or type 2 diabetes, but the evidence is heterogeneous with methodological limitations. Trans fats are associated with all cause mortality, total CHD, and CHD mortality, probably because of higher levels of intake of industrial trans fats than ruminant trans fats. Dietary guidelines must carefully consider the health effects of recommendations for alternative macronutrients to replace trans fats and saturated fats.

Consumption of trans fatty acids is related to plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher intake of trans fatty acids may negatively affect endothelial function, partially explaining the greater cardiovascular risk linked to trans fat than its adverse effects on lipids.

Abstract:Trans fatty acid intake has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The relation is explained only partially by the adverse effect of these fatty acids on the lipid profile. We examined whether trans fatty acid intake could also affect biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR-2), E-selectin, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1). We conducted a cross-sectional study of 730 women from the Nurses' Health Study I cohort, aged 43-69 y, free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes at time of blood draw (1989-1990). Dietary intake was assessed by a validated FFQ in 1986 and 1990. CRP levels were 73% higher among those in the highest quintile of trans fat intake, compared with the lowest quintile. IL-6 levels were 17% higher, sTNFR-2 5%, E-selectin 20%, sICAM-1 10%, and sVCAM-1 levels 10% higher. Trans fatty acid intake was positively related to plasma concentration of CRP (P = 0.009), sTNFR-2 (P = 0.002), E-selectin (P = 0.003), sICAM-1 (P = 0.007), and sVCAM-1 (P = 0.001) in linear regression models after controlling for age, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, intake of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fatty acids, and postmenopausal hormone therapy. In conclusion, this study suggests that higher intake of trans fatty acids could adversely affect endothelial function, which might partially explain why the positive relation between trans fat and cardiovascular risk is greater than one would predict based solely on its adverse effects on lipids.

Dietary Fat and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: Recent Controversies and Advances.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats significantly reduces cardiovascular disease risk, while trans fat intake increases it.

Abstract:Health effects of dietary fats have been extensively studied for decades. However, controversies exist on the effects of various types of fatty acids, especially saturated fatty acid (SFA), on cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current evidence supports that different types of dietary fatty acids have divergent effects on CVD risk, and the effects also depend strongly on the comparison or replacement macronutrient. A significant reduction in CVD risk can be achieved if SFAs are replaced by unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids. Intake of industrially produced trans fat is consistently associated with higher CVD risk. Both n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with lower CVD risk, although the effects of fish oil supplementation remains inconsistent. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans place greater emphasis on types of dietary fat than total amount of dietary fat and recommend replacing SFAs with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids for CVD prevention.

Key takeaways:Higher intake of MUFAs and PUFAs is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, while higher intake of saturated and trans-fats increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
Dietary fat quality and fat replacement are more important for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention than is total dietary fat intake.

OBJECTIVE
The aim was to evaluate the association between total fat intake and fat subtypes with the risk of CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) and cardiovascular and all-cause death. We also examined the hypothetical effect of the isocaloric substitution of one macronutrient for another.

DESIGN
We prospectively studied 7038 participants at high CVD risk from the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study. The trial was conducted from 2003 to 2010, but the present analysis was based on an expanded follow-up until 2012. At baseline and yearly thereafter, total and specific fat subtypes were repeatedly measured by using validated food-frequency questionnaires. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used.

RESULTS
After 6 y of follow-up, we documented 336 CVD cases and 414 total deaths. HRs (95% CIs) for CVD for those in the highest quintile of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake compared with those in the lowest quintile were 0.58 (0.39, 0.86), 0.50 (0.31, 0.81), and 0.68 (0.48, 0.96), respectively. In the comparison between extreme quintiles, higher saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans-fat intakes were associated with 81% (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.13) and 67% (HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.57) higher risk of CVD. Inverse associations with all-cause death were also observed for PUFA and MUFA intakes. Isocaloric replacements of SFAs with MUFAs and PUFAs or trans fat with MUFAs were associated with a lower risk of CVD. SFAs from pastries and processed foods were associated with a higher risk of CVD.

CONCLUSIONS
Intakes of MUFAs and PUFAs were associated with a lower risk of CVD and death, whereas SFA and trans-fat intakes were associated with a higher risk of CVD. The replacement of SFAs with MUFAs and PUFAs or of trans fat with MUFAs was inversely associated with CVD. This trial was registered at as ISRCTN 35739639.

Study of the effect of trans fatty acids from ruminants on blood lipids and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Number of 

Key takeaways:High dietary intake of trans fatty acids from ruminants may negatively affect cholesterol homeostasis, while moderate intakes above current human consumption have neutral effects on plasma lipids and other cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Abstract:BACKGROUND
The intake of trans fatty acids (TFA) from industrially hydrogenated vegetable oils (iTFA) is known to have a deleterious effect on cardiovascular health, the effects of TFA from ruminants (rTFA) are virtually unknown.

OBJECTIVE
The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of rTFA and iTFA on plasma LDL concentrations and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy subjects.

DESIGN
In a double-blind, randomized crossover controlled study, 38 healthy men were fed each of 4 experimental isoenergetic diets lasting 4 wk each. The 4 diets were high in rTFA (10.2 g/2500 kcal), moderate in rTFA (4.2 g/2500 kcal), high in iTFA (10.2 g/2500 kcal), and low in TFA from any source (2.2 g/2500 kcal) (control diet).

RESULTS
Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher after the high- rTFA diet than after the control (P = 0.03) or the moderate- rTFA (P = 0.002) diet. Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations also were significantly (P = 0.02) higher after the iTFA diet than after the moderate-rTFA diet. Plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations were significantly (P = 0.02) lower after the high-rTFA diet than after the moderate-rTFA diet. Finally, all risk factors were comparable between the control and the moderate-rTFA diets.

CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that, whereas a high dietary intake of TFA from ruminants may adversely affect cholesterol homeostasis, moderate intakes of rTFA that are well above the upper limit of current human consumption have neutral effects on plasma lipids and other cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Key takeaways:High trans fatty acid intake exacerbates metabolic diseases like diabetes and fatty liver, leading to intestinal inflammation and impaired glucose tolerance.

Abstract:Background and Aims Many nutritional and epidemiological studies have shown that high consumption of trans fatty acids can cause several adverse effects on human health, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effect of trans fatty acids on innate immunity in the gut by observing mice fed with a diet high in trans fatty acids, which have been reported to cause dysbiosis. Methods We used C57BL6/J mice and fed them with normal diet (ND) or high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) or high-trans fatty acid, high-sucrose diet (HTHSD) for 12 weeks. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on the mice stool samples, in addition to flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and lipidomics analysis of the mice serum and liver samples. RAW264.7 cells were used for the in vitro studies. Results Mice fed with HTHSD displayed significantly higher blood glucose levels and advanced fatty liver and intestinal inflammation, as compared to mice fed with HFHSD. Furthermore, compared to mice fed with HFHSD, mice fed with HTHSD displayed a significant elevation in the expression of CD36 in the small intestine, along with a reduction in the expression of IL-22. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the populations of ILC1s and T-bet-positive ILC3s in the lamina propria in mice fed with HTHSD. Finally, the relative abundance of the family Desulfovibrionaceae, which belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, was significantly higher in mice fed with HFHSD or HTHSD, than in mice fed with ND; between the HFHSD and HTHSD groups, the abundance was slightly higher in the HTHSD group. Conclusions This study revealed that compared to saturated fatty acid intake, trans fatty acid intake significantly exacerbated metabolic diseases such as diabetes and fatty liver.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive consumption of salt, saturated fat, and trans fat contributes to cardiovascular diseases in Brazil, with higher direct and indirect costs for males aged 45-74 years old.

Abstract:Objective To evaluate the direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular diseases (such as coronary heart disease and stroke) by sex and age group, attributed to the excessive consumption of salt, saturated fat and trans fat in Brazil. Materials and methods The data for estimating the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) corresponding to the consumption of salt, saturated fat and trans-fat were obtained from the Household Budget Survey 2017–2018. The calculation of direct costs for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) was made from the accounting sum of costs with hospitalizations and outpatient care found in the National Health System (Hospital Information System and Outpatient Information System), from 2017 to 2019, including the costs of treatment, such as medical consultations, medical procedures, and drugs. Regarding the indirect costs, they were measured by the loss of human capital, given the premature death, resulting in loss of productivity. To define the attributable costs, they were multiplied by the PAF. Results Higher burden of CVD attributable to the consumption of salt, saturated fat and trans fat were observed in younger individuals, which progressively decreased with advancing age, but still generated economic costs in the order of US$ 7.18 billion, in addition to 1.53 million productive years of life lost (YLL) to premature death, if considering salt as an inducer. Although attributable burden of CVD is higher among younger individuals, the highest costs are associated with males aged 45 to 74 years old for direct costs and 45 to 64 years old for indirect costs. Conclusion The attributable fractions to consumption of salt are the ones that cause the most effects on CVD, followed by saturated fat and trans fat, with direct and indirect costs being higher for males.

Dietary trans-fatty acid intake in relation to cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Number of 

Key takeaways:High consumption of trans-fatty acids is associated with a higher risk of prostate and colorectal cancer, but the exact carcinogenic subtypes remain unclear.

Abstract:CONTEXT
Apart from ruminant fat, trans-fatty acids are produced during the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils, (eg, in the production of ultraprocessed foods). Harmful cardiovascular effects of trans-fatty acids are already proven, but the link with cancer risk has not yet been summarized.

OBJECTIVE
A systematic review (following PRISMA guidelines) - including observational studies on the association of trans-fatty acid intake with any cancer risk - was conducted, with no limitations on population types.

DATA SOURCES
The electronic databases PubMed and Embase were searched to identify relevant studies.

DATA EXTRACTION
This systematic review included 46 articles. Quality was assessed via the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analyses were conducted if at least 4 articles exploring the same transfat-cancer pairings were found.

DATA ANALYSIS
Nineteen cancer types have been researched in cohort and case-control studies on trans-fatty acids, with breast cancer (n = 17), prostate cancer (n = 11), and colorectal cancer (n = 9) as the most researched. The meta-analyses on total trans-fat showed a significant positive association for prostate cancer (odds ratio 1.49; 95%CI, 1.13-1.95) and colorectal cancer (OR 1.26; 95%CI, 1.08-1.46) but not for breast cancer (OR 1.12; 95%CI, 0.99-1.26), ovarian cancer (OR 1.10; 95%CI, 0.94-1.28), or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR 1.32; 95%CI, 0.99-1.76). Results were dependent on the fatty acid subtype, with even cancer-protective associations for some partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Enhancing moderators in the positive transfat-cancer relation were gender (direction was cancer-site specific), European ancestry, menopause, older age, and overweight.

CONCLUSION
Despite heterogeneity, higher risk of prostate and colorectal cancer by high consumption of trans-fatty acids was found. Future studies need methodological improvements (eg, using long-term follow-up cancer data and intake biomarkers). Owing to the lack of studies testing trans-fatty acid subtypes in standardized ways, it is not clear which subtypes (eg, ruminant sources) are more carcinogenic.

A Review of Cholesterol's Dual Impact: Human Health and Environmental Consequences

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive consumption of saturated fatty acids in fatty foods can contribute to coronary heart diseases and strokes, necessitating a comprehensive review of their effects on human health and the environment.

Abstract:Abstract 
Indiscriminate consumption of fatty foods especially those with higher percentage of saturated fatty acids in and around the world is likely to be in excesses in few years to come. This is particularly so owing to man detrimental eating habits. And this portends a potential risk for coronary heart diseases among unsuspecting consumers. Although man has the enzymatic capacity to convert excess fatty acids to harmless substrates within the body system, but there occur serious pressure on such functions when they are in excesses of the normal daily body requirement. The impact of heavily rich fat meals to the large supply of total fats and its saturated fatty acids derivatives in the human system has been largely traced to dietary intake of lipid rich diets. Their consequential effect over time can damage arteries, contribute to heart disease, and even stroke among unsuspecting consumers. Incidentally this has been traced to cholesterol (lipoprotein), a waxy substance that the body requires to perform certain critical functions including digestion, circulation, and growth and even the nervous system regulation. There are two distinct forms are known these lipoproteins; high density and Low density lipoproteins. Even though both are essential, the excessive intake of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is dangerous could trigger certain cardiovascular diseases and even death due to its excessive accumulation in the body. In spite of these foregoing however, they plays very critical roles in the life of virtually all living organisms including man. Therefore it harps on the study for a comprehensive review about the concept and dispels the misinformation about the significance and implication of effects of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as probable precursor for certain cardiovascular ailments. Little wonder that some conscious individuals are cautious in choosing their meals owing to this trepidation.  It therefore becomes imperative to undertake a study on related works with a view to giving suitable medical information to arm individuals with reliable data towards the trend.

Mechanisms of Action of trans Fatty Acids

Number of 

Key takeaways:Industrial trans fatty acids promote inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and cholesterol synthesis, while cis-unsaturated fatty acids protect against these effects and promote fat storage in the liver.

Abstract:ABSTRACT Human studies have established a positive association between the intake of industrial trans fatty acids and the development of cardiovascular diseases, leading several countries to enact laws that restrict the presence of industrial trans fatty acids in food products. However, trans fatty acids cannot be completely eliminated from the human diet since they are also naturally present in meat and dairy products of ruminant animals. Moreover, bans on industrial trans fatty acids have not yet been instituted in all countries. The epidemiological evidence against trans fatty acids by far overshadows mechanistic insights that may explain how trans fatty acids achieve their damaging effects. This review focuses on the mechanisms that underlie the deleterious effects of trans fatty acids by juxtaposing effects of trans fatty acids against those of cis-unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids (SFAs). This review also carefully explores the argument that ruminant trans fatty acids have differential effects from industrial trans fatty acids. Overall, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that industrial trans fatty acids promote inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, although to a lesser degree than SFAs, whereas cis-unsaturated fatty acids are protective against ER stress and inflammation. Additionally, industrial trans fatty acids promote fat storage in the liver at the expense of adipose tissue compared with cis-unsaturated fatty acids and SFAs. In cultured hepatocytes and adipocytes, industrial trans fatty acids, but not cis-unsaturated fatty acids or SFAs, stimulate the cholesterol synthesis pathway by activating sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) 2–mediated gene regulation. Interestingly, although industrial and ruminant trans fatty acids show similar effects on human plasma lipoproteins, in preclinical models, only industrial trans fatty acids promote inflammation, ER stress, and cholesterol synthesis. Overall, clearer insight into the molecular mechanisms of action of trans fatty acids may create new therapeutic windows for the treatment of diseases characterized by disrupted lipid metabolism.

The intake of high fat diet with different trans fatty acid levels differentially induces oxidative stress and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats

Key takeaways:High-fat diets with different trans fatty acid levels can cause liver damage and non alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats, with margarine being a direct source of oxidative stress.

Abstract:Trans-fatty acids (TFA) are known as a risk factor for coronary artery diseases, insulin resistance and obesity accompanied by systemic inflammation, the features of metabolic syndrome. Little is known about the effects on the liver induced by lipids and also few studies are focused on the effect of foods rich in TFAs on hepatic functions and oxidative stress. This study investigates whether high-fat diets with different TFA levels induce oxidative stress and liver dysfunction in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups (n = 12/group): C receiving standard-chow; Experimental groups that were fed high-fat diet included 20% fresh soybean oil diet (FSO), 20% oxidized soybean oil diet (OSO) and 20% margarine diet (MG). Each group was kept on the treatment for 4 weeks. A liver damage was observed in rats fed with high-fat diet via increase of liver lipid peroxidation and decreased hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase). The intake of oxidized oil led to higher levels of lipid peroxidation and a lower concentration of plasma antioxidants in comparison to rats fed with FSO. The higher inflammatory response in the liver was induced by MG diet. Liver histopathology from OSO and MG groups showed respectively moderate to severe cytoplasm vacuolation, hypatocyte hypertrophy, hepatocyte ballooning, and necroinflammation. It seems that a strong relationship exists between the consumption of TFA in the oxidized oils and lipid peroxidation and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The extent of the peroxidative events in liver was also different depending on the fat source suggesting that feeding margarine with higher TFA levels may represent a direct source of oxidative stress for the organism. The present study provides evidence for a direct effect of TFA on NAFLD.

LDL receptor knockout weaning male mice were fed for 16 wk with diets containing 40% energy as either trans fatty acids (TRANS), PUFA, or SFA. Afterwards, subcutaneous and epididymal fat were weighed and histological markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were assessed according to the Histological Scoring System for NAFLD. PPARalpha, PPARgamma, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT-1), and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) mRNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Food intake was similar in the 3 groups, although mice fed the TRANS diet gained less weight than those receiving the PUFA diet. Compared with the PUFA- and SFA-fed mice, TRANS-fed mice had greater plasma total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations, less epididymal and subcutaneous fat, larger livers with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-like lesions, and greater liver TC and TG concentrations. Macrosteatosis in TRANS-fed mice was associated with a higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)) index and upregulated mRNA related to hepatic fatty acid synthesis (SREBP-1c and PPARgamma) and to downregulated MTP mRNA. Diet consumption did not alter hepatic mRNA related to fatty acid oxidation (PPARalpha and CPT-1). In conclusion, compared with PUFA- and SFA-fed mice, TRANS-fed mice had less adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance characterized by greater HOMA(IR) index, and NASH-like lesions due to greater hepatic lipogenesis. These results demonstrate the role of trans fatty acid intake on the development of key features of metabolic syndrome.

Key takeaways:A trans-fatty acid-rich diet promotes liver tumorigenesis in HCV core gene transgenic mice, suggesting that HCV-infected patients should avoid such diets to prevent tumor development.

Abstract:Excess consumption of trans-fatty acid (TFA), an unsaturated fatty acid containing trans double bonds, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. However, little is known about the link between TFA and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite it being a frequent form of cancer in humans. In the current study, the impact of excessive dietary TFA on hepatic tumorigenesis was assessed using hepatitis C virus (HCV) core gene transgenic mice that spontaneously developed HCC. Male transgenic mice were treated for 5 months with either a control diet or an isocaloric TFA-rich diet that replaced the majority of soybean oil with shortening. The prevalence of liver tumors was significantly higher in TFA-rich diet-fed transgenic mice compared with control diet-fed transgenic mice. The TFA-rich diet significantly increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NRF2), leading to high p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) expression. Furthermore, the TFA diet activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and stimulated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, synergistically up-regulating cyclin D1 and c-Myc, driving cell proliferation. Excess TFA intake also promoted fibrogenesis and ductular reaction, presumably contributing to accelerated liver tumorigenesis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that a TFA-rich diet promotes hepatic tumorigenesis, mainly due to persistent activation of NF-κB and NRF2-p62/SQSTM1 signaling, ERK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, and fibrogenesis. Therefore, HCV-infected patients should avoid a TFA-rich diet to prevent liver tumor development.

fatty food Consumption and its Effects on Liver health

Number of 

Key takeaways:A diet low in saturated and trans fats, and high in polyunsaturated fats, can reduce the risk of liver disease and other health problems.

Abstract:Fat is essential for health.Some fats are beneficial for health & some are harmful.The type of fat consumed is more important than the amount of fat consumed.This is a review paper where different studies and views of various authors are observed for getting information and stats, many websites like Pubmed, Google Scholars etc and journals by the various author have been referred by the researcher.The consumption of dietary fats and its effect on health.Eating too much and the wrong kinds of fats, such as saturated and trans fat, may rise levels of low-density lipoprotein or LDL, or 'bad' cholesterol.Elevated LDL cholesterol in the blood may increase a person's risk of heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and liver disease.Both poly-and monounsaturated fats help in lowering low-density lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol) and subsequently reducing the risk of heart disease.It is recommended to consume a diet that is low in saturated and trans fats, and high in polyunsaturated fats, limiting the intake of most saturated fats and consuming enough unsaturated fats, is the ideal approach to a healthful diet in the long-term.Dietary changes can have unexpected effects on health, especially for people with underlying health conditions and heart problems. HIgHlIgHtSm Fatty food consumption has become a major health concern in recent years, as it is associated with a wide range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and liver disease.m Fatty foods, such as those high in saturated and trans fats, are contribute to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).m Saturated fats, which are found in animal products such as red meat and dairy, have been shown to have a particularly negative impact on the liver.On the other hand, polyunsaturated fats, which are found in foods such as nuts, seeds, and fish, have been shown to have a beneficial effect on liver health.m The type and amount of fat consumed, as well as the overall dietary pattern, play important roles in the development of liver disease.To reduce the risk of liver disease, it's recommended to consume a diet that is low in saturated fat and high in polyunsaturated fat, and to limit the consumption of processed foods, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars.m By adopting a healthy and balanced diet, individuals can reduce the risk of developing liver disease and other health problems associated with fatty food consumption.

Addition of trans-fat and alcohol has divergent effects on atherogenic diet-induced liver injury in rodent models of steatohepatitis.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Trans-fat reduces inflammation in atherogenic diet-induced liver injury, but increases steatosis and dyslipidemia, while alcohol increases inflammation and fibrogenic phenotype.

Abstract:Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are common causes of chronic liver disease. The overlap between ALD and NAFLD suggests the existence of metabolic steatohepatitis. Development of in vivo models that reflect various aspects of human steatohepatitis is essential for drug discovery. We aimed to characterize several models of steatohepatitis (SH) and to investigate whether the pathology could be modulated. Methods Sprague Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 9 weeks, followed by either a high-fat, high cholesterol and cholate diet (HFC) or a HFC diet containing 13% trans-fat (HFC-TF). A subset received 15% ethanol water twice a week for 12 weeks. Serum triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, AST, ALT and rPRO-C3. The liver was weighed and evaluated using modified NASH-CRN criteria. Results All diets induced hepatomegaly but only HFC-TF increased the size of visceral adipose tissue. Trans-fat augmented HFC-induced dyslipidemia, cholesterol was higher and HDL was lower in the HFC-TF groups. Alcohol lowered triglycerides in both dietary groups. HFC elevated ALT and AST, which was lowered by trans-fat. All diets induced histological SH, addition of trans-fat induced a more steatotic but less inflammation. Inclusion of alcohol augmented the HFC-induced inflammation. All diets induced mild fibrosis. Inclusion of trans-fat and alcohol significantly increased rPRO-C3. Conclusion The addition of trans-fat reduced the HFC-induced inflammation but augmented steatosis and dyslipidemia. Inclusion of alcohol induced a more inflammatory and fibrogenic phenotype.

TRANS FATTY ACIDS AND NON-TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES

Number of 

Key takeaways:Excessive consumption of trans fatty acids is linked to various non-communicable diseases, highlighting the need for harmonization of national and European regulations and joint industry-state body activities.

Abstract:Objectives. Solid fats, obtained industrially through the process of hydrogenation of vegetable oils, have found a very wide use in the food field. At the same time, they have a high content of trans fatty acids, these being also known as 'trans fats'. Recent researches have revealed the adverse effects of trans fatty acids on health. The high content of trans fatty acids contributes, in particular, to the emergence of non-communicable diseases. That is why it was conducted a bibliographic study, in order to elucidate the various harmful effects of trans fatty acids on health and its prevention possibilities.
Material and methods. An advanced literature search was performed using the Google Scholar search engine and the PubMed, Research for Life and Medline databases. The criteria for selecting the items included health issues, according to the keywords trans fatty acids, trans fats, health, non-communicable diseases.
Results. The direct connection of excessive consumption of trans fatty acids, with various non-communicable diseases, has been found. It largely affects the lipid spectrum of the blood, the circulatory system, in general, but also other systems and organs, including the reproductive system in men. Some forms of cancer, cognitive impairment in the elderly, the detrimental effect on the fetus, can also be caused by excessive consumption of hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats high in trans fatty acids.
Conclusion. There is a need to harmonize national legislation with European legislation on trans fatty acids regulations, formalize control methods, joint activities of state bodies with representatives of the food industry in order to improve the situation on the issue.

Overfeeding Polyunsaturated and Saturated Fat Causes Distinct Effects on Liver and Visceral Fat Accumulation in Humans

Number of 

Key takeaways:Overeating saturated fatty acids promotes liver and visceral fat storage, while excess energy from polyunsaturated fatty acids may promote lean tissue in healthy humans.

Abstract:Excess ectopic fat storage is linked to type 2 diabetes. The importance of dietary fat composition for ectopic fat storage in humans is unknown. We investigated liver fat accumulation and body composition during overfeeding saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). LIPOGAIN was a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized trial. Thirty-nine young and normal-weight individuals were overfed muffins high in SFAs (palm oil) or n-6 PUFAs (sunflower oil) for 7 weeks. Liver fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), total adipose tissue, pancreatic fat, and lean tissue were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Transcriptomics were performed in SAT. Both groups gained similar weight. SFAs, however, markedly increased liver fat compared with PUFAs and caused a twofold larger increase in VAT than PUFAs. Conversely, PUFAs caused a nearly threefold larger increase in lean tissue than SFAs. Increase in liver fat directly correlated with changes in plasma SFAs and inversely with PUFAs. Genes involved in regulating energy dissipation, insulin resistance, body composition, and fat-cell differentiation in SAT were differentially regulated between diets, and associated with increased PUFAs in SAT. In conclusion, overeating SFAs promotes hepatic and visceral fat storage, whereas excess energy from PUFAs may instead promote lean tissue in healthy humans.

The Impact of Macronutrient Intake on Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD): Too Much Fat, Too Much Carbohydrate, or Just Too Many Calories?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Different types of fat and carbohydrates influence liver fat accumulation, with saturated fats and fructose increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Abstract:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing epidemic, in parallel with the obesity crisis, rapidly becoming one of the commonest causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Diet and physical activity are important determinants of liver fat accumulation related to insulin resistance, dysfunctional adipose tissue, and secondary impaired lipid storage and/or increased lipolysis. While it is evident that a hypercaloric diet (an overconsumption of calories) promotes liver fat accumulation, it is also clear that the macronutrient composition can modulate this risk. A number of other baseline factors modify the overfeeding response, which may be genetic or environmental. Although it is difficult to disentangle the effects of excess calories vs. specifically the individual effects of excessive carbohydrates and/or fats, isocaloric, and hypercaloric dietary intervention studies have been implemented to provide insight into the effects of different macronutrients, sub-types and their relative balance, on the regulation of liver fat. What has emerged is that different types of fat and carbohydrates differentially influence liver fat accumulation, even when diets are isocaloric. Furthermore, distinct molecular and metabolic pathways mediate the effects of carbohydrates and fat intake on hepatic steatosis. Fat accumulation appears to act through impairments in lipid storage and/or increased lipolysis, whereas carbohydrate consumption has been shown to promote liver fat accumulation through de novo lipogenesis. Effects differ dependent upon carbohydrate and fat type. Saturated fat and fructose induce the greatest increase in intrahepatic triglycerides (IHTG), insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides compared with unsaturated fats, which have been found to be protective. Decreased intake of saturated fats and avoidance of added sugars are therefore the two most important dietary interventions that can lead to a reduction in IHTG and potentially the associated risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A healthy and balanced diet and regular physical activity must remain the cornerstones of effective lifestyle intervention to prevent the development and progression of NAFLD. Considering the sub-type of each macronutrient, in addition to the quantity, are critical determinants of liver health.

Out of the frying pan: dietary saturated fat influences nonalcoholic fatty liver disease

Number of 

Key takeaways:Saturated fat intake has immediate effects on metabolic function, increasing insulin resistance, hepatic triglycerides, and gluconeogenesis in humans and mice.

Abstract:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excess accumulation of fat in the liver. In some cases, NAFLD is also accompanied by insulin resistance, resulting in metabolic dysfunction. Dietary fat content probably influences both NAFLD and insulin resistance; however, the immediate effects of fat consumption have not been fully explored. In this issue of the JCI, Hernández et al. evaluated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in humans and mice following a single oral dose of saturated fat. This one bolus of fat resulted in a measurable increase in insulin resistance, hepatic triglycerides, and gluconeogenesis. In mice, the saturated fat bolus resulted in the induction of several NAFLD-associated genes. Together, the results of this study indicate that saturated fat intake has immediate effects on metabolic function.

A High-Fat, High-Fructose Diet Induces Antioxidant Imbalance and Increases the Risk and Progression of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Mice

Number of 

Key takeaways:A high-fat, high-fructose diet increases the risk and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice by causing liver damage and oxidative stress.

Abstract:Excessive fat liver is an important manifestation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. In the present study, the effects of a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD) on mRNA levels and activities of the antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), were determined in mouse livers and brains. The histomorphology of the livers was examined and the state of nonenzymatic reducing system was evaluated by measuring the glutathione system and the lipid peroxidation. Histopathology of the liver showed that fat accumulation and inflammation depended on the period of the HFFD-consumption. The levels of mRNA and enzymatic activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx were raised, followed by the increases in malondialdehyde levels in livers and brains of the HFFD mice. The oxidized GSSG content was increased while the total GSH and the reduced GSH were decreased, resulting in the increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio in both livers and brains of the HFFD mice. These observations suggested that liver damage and oxidative stress in the significant organs were generated by continuous HFFD-consumption. Imbalance of antioxidant condition induced by long-term HFFD-consumption might increase the risk and progression of NAFLD.

Trans Fats and Metabolic Syndrome

Number of 

Key takeaways:Metabolic syndrome and trans fats may have both positive and negative correlations, affecting health.

Abstract:Two issues affecting health today are metabolic syndrome and trans fats. Metabolic syndrome is a common condition that has no single known cause. Trans fats are fatty acids that can be artificially made and added to food, or can naturally occur in ruminant-derived foods. There has been speculation that metabolic syndrome and trans fats are correlated. Studies indicate both positive and negative correlations between metabolic syndrome and the consumption of trans fats.

Trans Fats Consumption and Body Mass Index in Cross Sectional Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Greater dietary trans fatty acid consumption is associated with higher BMI and waist circumference in humans, supporting the idea that food composition and caloric intake influence BMI.

Abstract:Background: Trans fats remain on the market in parts of the world. Emerging evidence suggests that factors beyond calorie balance may affect fat deposition and body mass index (BMI). Trans fats are prooxidant, proinflammatory, and have shown adverse metabolic effects and increased fat deposition in animals. Objective: To assess the relation of dietary trans fatty acid consumption (dTFA) to BMI in humans. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a broadly-sampling study. Setting: Community-dwelling adults from Southern California. Participants: 1018 adult men and women aged 20-85 without known diabetes, CVD, or cancer, with screening LDL 115-190mg/dL. Women of procreative potential and children were excluded. Measurements: Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured, and BMI calculated (kg/m2). The Fred Hutchinson Food Frequency Questionnaire provided data on dTFA (grams/day) and calories consumed. Additional covariates included activity, chocolate consumption frequency, and mood. Regression assessed the relation of BMI (outcome) to dTFA, unadjusted and in models adjusting for age and sex, and adding calories and activity, chocolate consumption frequency, and mood. Results: Higher dTFA was associated with higher BMI and waist circumference. The coefficient was strengthened, not attenuated, with adjustment for calories and activity, and other assessed covariates. In the fully adjusted model, each gram/day of dTFAs was associated with 0.44 higher BMI (SE=0.12;95%CI=0.21,0.67); P<0.001 and 1cm greater waist circumference (SE=0.35;95%CI=0.37,1.7); P=0.003. Conclusion: Findings relating greater dTFA to higher BMI in humans comport with experimental data in animals, extend adverse metabolic associations of dTFA, and buttress evidence that foods composition, as well as caloric number, bears on BMI. Findings are cross-sectional but strength and consistency of association, biological gradient, and biological plausibility add weight to the prospect of a causal connection.

Low intake of ruminant trans fatty acids ameliorates the disordered lipid metabolism in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Low intake of ruminant trans fatty acids (0.15% E) improves disordered lipid metabolism and reduces body weight gain in mice fed a high-fat diet, while having no significant effect on low-fat diet mice.

Abstract:Currently, the health benefits of ruminant trans fatty acids (R-TFA) are still controversial. Our previous investigations indicated that R-TFA at higher dosages (1.3% and 4% E) caused disordered lipid metabolism in mice; however, through collecting R-TFA intake data in 9 provinces of China, it was suggested that, in 2021, the range of R-TFA intake for Chinese residents was about 0.053-0.307 g d-1. Based on the 2022 Nutritional Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents, the recommended daily energy supply from R-TFA was about 0.11%-0.15% E. However, the health effects of R-TFA at a lower dosage are still unknown; therefore, our current research aims to further explore the effects of R-TFA on health. Through in vivo experiments, it was shown that R-TFA (0.15% E) decreased body weight gain and serum cholesterol levels in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet, while it had no significant effect on mice fed a low-fat diet. Besides, hepatic histopathology analysis suggested that R-TFA (0.15% E) ameliorated the degree of hepatic steatosis and reduced intrahepatocyte lipid droplet accumulation in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet. Through lipidomics analysis, we further screened 8 potential lipid metabolites that participate in regulating the dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Finally, it was suggested that R-TFA (0.15% E) down-regulated the expression of genes related to inflammation and cholesterol synthesis while up-regulated the expression of genes related to cholesterol clearance, which might partially explain the salutary effect of R-TFA (0.15% E) in ameliorating the hepatic steatosis and improving disordered lipid metabolism in mice fed a high-fat diet. Our current research will provide a reference for the intake of R-TFA and, furthermore, give some insights into understanding the health effects of R-TFA.

1182-P: Trans Fatty Acid Intake Induces Impaired Glucose Tolerance via Dysbiosis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Trans fatty acid intake impairs glucose tolerance by inducing intestinal inflammation, potentially contributing to various metabolic disorders.

Abstract:Trans fatty acids (TFAs) are known to increase the risk for various metabolic syndromes. The effect of TFA on dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation, especially caused by modifying innate immunity, were evaluated. Eight-week-old C57BL6/J male mice were treated with a normal diet (ND), high saturated fatty acid high sucrose diet (HFHSD), and high TFA high sucrose diet (HTHSD) for 12 weeks (A). There was no significant difference in body weight, oral intake, liver or visceral fat weight between the HFHSD and HTHSD groups (B-E). On the other hand, the HTHSD group showed more impaired glucose tolerance than the HFHSD group (p=0.015) (F and G). Multicolor flow cytometry analysis revealed that the T-bet-positive ILC3/CD45-positive cell number ratio and the M1/M2 macrophage ratio in the small intestinal lamina propria were significantly increased in the HTHSD group (p<0.001) (H-K) and the Proteobacteria phylum were significantly increased in the HTHSD group (p<0.001) (L). The concentrations of elaidic acid in liver and serum assessed by GC/MS system were significantly higher in the HTHSD group (M and N). In RAW264.7 cells treated with palmitic acid or elaidic acid, no significant difference was observed in IL-1b positive cells, but IL-12-positive cells in elaidic acid were significantly increased (O and P). These results suggesting that TFAs cause various metabolic disorders by inducing intestinal inflammation.View largeDownload slideView largeDownload slide DisclosureT. Okamura: None. R. Bamba: None.

Interaction of CETP rs708272 Polymorphism on Trans Fatty Acid Intake and Glucose Metabolism Markers

Number of 

Key takeaways:Higher trans fatty acid intake and the GG genotype in CETP polymorphism are associated with less reduction in glucose metabolism markers, suggesting limiting intake for individuals with this genotype.

Abstract:Dietary fats influence gene expression and several metabolic pathways. Therefore, it is crucial to study the role of personal genotypes in the interaction between fat consumption and cardiometabolic markers. This research aimed to determine the interaction of the rs708272 polymorphism of CETP and the fatty acid intake with changes in the HOMA-IR in adults living with overweight or obesity. The current study was a secondary analysis of an 8-week controlled clinical trial. The final sample for this analysis comprised 78 Mexican adults with the Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) rs708272 polymorphism who followed a dietary intervention. Using an interaction analysis, we evaluated the fatty acid intake and the genotypes of rs708272, with changes in blood glucose, insulin, and the HOMA-IR from baseline to endpoint. Our findings suggest a significant interaction between the trans fatty acid intake and the GG genotype with changes in glucose (p = 0.024), insulin (p = 0.004), and the HOMA-IR (p = 0.002). The higher the consumption of trans fatty acids, the less these markers of glucose metabolism were reduced. carriers of the GG genotype may benefit from limiting dietary trans fatty acid intake, as there was no reduction in plasma glucose and insulin despite a hypocaloric dietary intervention in adults with overweight and obesity.

Key takeaways:High-fat diets, regardless of fatty acid composition, cause obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors in obese mice.

Abstract:Excessive consumption of high-fat diets is associated with disordered metabolic responses, which may lead to chronic diseases. High-fat diets containing different types of fatty acids lead to distinct alterations in metabolic responses of gut-brain axis.In our study, normal male C57BL/6J mice were fed to multiple high fatty acid diets (long-chain and medium-chain saturated fatty acid, LCSFA and MCSFA group; n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 PUFA group; monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA group; trans fatty acid, TFA group) and a basic diet (control, CON group) for 19 weeks. To investigate the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic responses of gut-brain axis in obese mice, blood lipids were detected by fast gas chromatography, and related proteins in brain and intestine were detected using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry analysis.All high-fat diets regardless of their fatty acid composition induced obesity, lipid disorders, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and changes in gut-brain axis related factors except basal diet in mice. For example, the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in ileum in the n-3 PUFA group was higher than that in the MCSFA group (P < 0.05). The expressions of insulin in hippocampus and leptin in ileum in the MCSFA group significantly increased, compared with other groups (all Ps < 0.05).The high MCSFA diet had the most effect on metabolic disorders in gut-brain axis, but the high n-3 PUFA diet had the least effect on changes in metabolism.

Olive oil consumption and its repercussions on lipid metabolism.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Extra virgin olive oil is healthful when used within a balanced diet, but excessive consumption may lead to adverse consequences on lipid metabolism.

Abstract:Consumption of highly processed foods, such as those high in trans fats and free sugars, coupled with sedentarism and chronic stress increases the risk of obesity and cardiometabolic disorders, while adherence to a Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with the prevalence of such diseases. Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet. Data accumulated thus far show consumption of extra virgin, (poly)phenol-rich olive oil to be associated with specific health benefits. Of note, recommendations for consumption based on health claims refer to the phenolic content of extra virgin olive oil as beneficial. However, even though foods rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as olive oil, are healthier than foods rich in saturated and trans fats, their inordinate use can lead to adverse effects on health. The aim of this review was to summarize the data on olive oil consumption worldwide and to critically examine the literature on the potential adverse effects of olive oil and its main components, particularly any effects on lipid metabolism. As demonstrated by substantial evidence, extra virgin olive oil is healthful and should be preferentially used within the context of a balanced diet, but excessive consumption may lead to adverse consequences.
