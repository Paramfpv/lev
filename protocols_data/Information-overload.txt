A negative factor affecting mental health, cognitive function, and sleep quality

Information overload is a state in which the amount of received stimuli and information exceeds the brain's processing capabilities. This phenomenon is intensifying in the digital age, leading to stress, fatigue, cognitive disturbances, and reduced quality of life. Excess digital content, doomscrolling, or constant access to social media exacerbate this problem, especially among young adults.

Level of evidence:Good

An excess of informational stimuli overloads the brain's cognitive mechanisms, leading to faster depletion of attention and energy resources. Chronic information overload disrupts the functioning of neural networks, increases stress levels, and results in decreased concentration, cognitive efficiency, and sleep quality. These effects can be amplified by doomscrolling and the use of digital devices before sleep.

Information overload is widely recognized as a significant factor negatively affecting mental health and cognitive functioning. Repeated and chronic experiences of information excess lead to increased stress, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disorders, which in turn can reduce quality of life and the ability to function effectively.

The scale of the problem of information overload is growing with the development of digital technologies and widespread access to social media. Millions of people worldwide experience its effects, resulting in deteriorating mental health and productivity.

Reduce exposure to screens, especially before bedtime, to minimize negative effects on sleep and well-being.

Final comment:The negative impact of regular information overload has been confirmed by numerous systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large-scale observational and experimental studies conducted on large human samples. The results of these studies are consistent and clearly indicate that chronic information excess—both in the context of work and private life—leads to increased stress, mood disturbances, digital fatigue, reduced cognitive performance, and poorer sleep quality. Experimental studies also show marked changes in the activity and connectivity of brain networks under conditions of information overload. Although some effects depend on individual factors (e.g., psychological resilience, age), the basic mechanisms are well documented in general populations. Thus, the evidence is good—broad, repeatedly confirmed, and based on many types of clinical studies, although there is still a need for very long-term prospective studies.

Key takeaways:Higher levels of perceived cyber-based information overload significantly predict greater stress, poorer health, and less time devoted to contemplative activities.

Abstract:The rapid growth and transmission of information in the digital age poses new challenges for individuals coping with the onslaught of communications from multiple sources. This research (a) conceptualizes and measures perceived information overload from cyber-based and place-based sources, (b) tests the reliability and validity of a newly developed Perceived Information Overload Scale, and (c) tests hypotheses concerning the psychological and health outcomes of information overload. A repeated-measures panel study design was used to test the proposed hypotheses. Confirmatory factor analyses provided support for the hypothesized two-factor model of perceived information overload, encompassing cyber-based and place-based sources of stimulation. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that higher levels of perceived cyber-based overload significantly predicted self-reports of greater stress, poorer health, and less time devoted to contemplative activities, controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and baseline measures of stress and health status. Participants’ sensation-seeking levels were found to significantly moderate the relationships between cyber-based, place-based, and composite perceived information overload and stress. Directions for further study are discussed.

From likes to anxiety: The effect of social media usage and in-formation overload on university students’ mental health

Number of 

Key takeaways:Social media usage and information overload are linked to higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in university students, highlighting the need for approaches to mitigate these adverse impacts.

Abstract:The widespread and excessive usage of social media among university students has caused significant awareness about its impact on mental health, specifically when connected with information overload. This study explores the interrelationship between social media usage and information overload on university students’ mental health disorders (stress, anxiety, and depression). Based on theoretical frameworks such as Cognitive Load Theory and Social Comparison Theory (SCT), the study explores how pervasive usage of social media contributes to mental health disorders with the mediating role of information overload. This mediator factor (information overload) offers a more thorough theoretical understanding of the underlying processes through which social media platforms (SMPs) can influence mental well-being. A quantitative research design survey surveyed 420 higher education students, and the data obtained was analyzed with PLS-SEM. The findings disclose that social media usage and information overload are linked to higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The study underlines the dual function of social media usage as both a means of connection and a driver of mental health disorders, highlighting the urgent need for approaches to mitigate the adverse impacts of information overload. These outcomes have significant implications for mental health professionals, professors, and higher education policymakers in advancing interventions to foster the well-being of university students in the information age.

Overloaded by Information or Worried About Missing Out on It: A Quantitative Study of Stress, Burnout, and Mental Health Implications in the Digital Workplace

Number of 

Key takeaways:Fear of missing out on information and information overload negatively impact employee mental health and well-being in the digital workplace.

Abstract:With growing numbers of workers relying on the digital workplace to get work done, attention is increasingly focused on the well-being impacts of digital working. This study explored the stress, burnout and mental health implications of employees’ digital workplace experience. Using the Job Demands-Resources model as a theoretical foundation, 142 workers were surveyed about their experiences of dark side of digital working effects (stress, overload, anxiety, and Fear of Missing Out) and well-being (exhaustion and mental health). Results from regression analyses indicated that the fear of missing out on information (IFoMO) is a risk factor for employee mental health and, along with information overload (IO), may lead to greater exhaustion. Additionally, both IFoMO and IO elevate digital workplace stress, further impacting well-being negatively. The results suggest that organizations need to optimize the flow of work-related information in the digital workplace and support employees to leverage information effectively. Plain language summary Impacts to employee well-being due to information in the digital workplace With growing numbers of workers relying on the digital workplace to get work done, attention is increasingly focused on the well-being impacts of digital working. This study explored stress, burnout and mental health issues that can arise for employees as a result of demands they experience when using technology at work. A total of 142 workers were surveyed about stress, overload, anxiety, and Fear of Missing Out relating to technology use. They were also asked about negative well-being impacts namely exhaustion and mental health issues. Results indicated that the fear of missing out on information is a risk factor for employee mental health and, along with information overload, may lead to greater exhaustion. In addition, both of these information related issues were found to elevate digital workplace stress, further impacting well-being negatively. The results suggest that organizations need to optimize the flow of work-related information in the digital workplace and support employees to leverage information effectively.

Drowning in the flood of information: a meta-analysis on the relation between information overload, behaviour, experience, and health and moderating factors

Key takeaways:Information overload negatively impacts people's behavior and experience, leading to stress, burnout, and fatigue, with different effects depending on vocational settings.

Abstract:ABSTRACT In the information age we live in, we are constantly threatened by being drowned in a huge flood of information. Information overload (IO) describes this state where information can no longer be adequately processed by an individual. However, the danger posed by IO to individuals as well as organizations can still not be assessed properly due to a missing integration of previous findings. In this quantitative meta-analysis, we analysed the data of 133.011 people within 117 studies, and overall, 330 effect sizes. We performed multi-level as well as robust variance estimation analyses and found, among other things, positive correlations between IO and information avoidance, stress states, burnout and fatigue, and negative correlations between IO and performance and satisfaction. Explorative subgroup analyses revealed different moderating effects based on different vocational settings. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis indicate a negative relationship between IO and peoples’ behaviour and experience, which call for an evaluation of the exchange and handling of information. Across a wide range of studies and contexts, this meta-analysis reveals that IO may provoke the information fatigue syndrome that has been poorly considered to date, leading to severe consequences in both work and home contexts.

The relationship between information overload and state of anxiety in the period of regular epidemic prevention and control in China: a moderated multiple mediation model

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload increases individual state anxiety during epidemic prevention and control, with risk perception and positive coping styles partially mediating this relationship, and resilience playing a moderating role.

Abstract:This study aimed to examine the relationship between information overload and individual state anxiety in the period of regular epidemic prevention and control and mediating effect of risk perception and positive coping styles. Further, we explored the moderating role of resilience. 847 Chinese participated in and completed measures of information overload, risk perception, positive coping styles, state anxiety, and resilience. The results of the analysis showed that information overload significantly predicted the level of individual state anxiety (β = 0.27, p < 0.001). Risk perception partially mediate the relationship between information overload and state anxiety (B = 0.08, 95%CI = ) and positive coping styles also partially mediate the relationship between information overload and state anxiety(B = -0.14, 95%CI = ). In addition, resilience moderated the mediating effects of risk perception (β = -0.07, p < 0.05) and positive coping styles (β = -0.19, p < 0.001). Resilience also moderated the effect of information overload on state anxiety (β = -0.13, p < 0.001). These results offer positive significance for understanding the internal mechanism of the influence of information overload on individual state anxiety in the epidemic environment and shed light on how to reduce people’s state anxiety during an epidemic.

The Negative Psychological Effects of Information Overload

Key takeaways:Information overload negatively impacts individuals' psychological health, leading to stress, depression, and social media fatigue, affecting decision-making quality and efficiency.

Abstract:Information overload (IO) is a state in which Information is beyond an individual's ability to accept, process, and respond. The human brain is limited to information processing capacity; when the input and output of Information mismatch, the individual will feel overwhelmed by tons of Information, resulting in anxiety, depression, and out of controlled psychological state. The idea of information overload has a long history. As early as the last century, it was applied by many scholars in enterprise management. The main consequence of information overload is the decline of decision-making quality and efficiency; decision-makers often need to consume more time and cognitive resources to deal with the task. In addition, the impact of information overload on mental health is often mentioned. Especially in the Internet era, people can receive more Information in a day than those who lived a hundred years ago combined in a lifetime. Massive amounts of instant Information build up to a state of life that requires a constant response; prolonged exposure to information overload can lead to personal stress, depression, and social media fatigue. It can be seen that information overload not only hurts people's work but also harms their physical and psychological health. Therefore, this paper will systematically describe the negative impact of information overload on individuals, especially psychological health, and provide some feasible suggestions.

How emotions affect the outcomes of information overload: information avoidance or information consumption?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Perceived information overload negatively affects peace of mind and positively affects fatigue and fear, affecting individuals' information avoidance intention and fear of missing out during public health emergencies.

Abstract:PurposeInformation overload has become ubiquitous during a public health emergency. The research purpose is to examine the role of mixed emotions in the influence of perceived information overload on individuals’ information avoidance intention and the state of fear of missing out.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-methods approach was used in this study: a qualitative study of 182 semi-structured interviews and a quantitative study of 309 surveys.FindingsThe results show that perceived information overload negatively affects peace of mind and positively affects fatigue and fear. Emotions with a low activation level (peace of mind and fatigue) promote emotions with a high activation level (hope and fear), and peace of mind negatively influences fatigue. Additionally, peace of mind negatively affects information avoidance intention, while hope positively affects the state of fear of missing out. These two information processing outcomes are positively impacted by fatigue and fear.Originality/valueThis study extends existing knowledge by uncovering the underlying influence of mixed emotions on individuals’ different information processing outcomes caused by perceived information overload. It provides practical insights for online media platforms and Internet users regarding how to process overwhelming information during a public health emergency.

The impact of mental health information overload on community education programs to enhance mental health-care seeking

Number of 

Key takeaways:High mental health information overload reduces interest in learning about mental health topics and reduces recommendations for appropriate care seeking.

Abstract:Purpose
Education programs seek to increase the public’s mental health literacy so they are better able to, among other things, help others engage in care when in need. This task may be diminished when such programs overwhelm participants with too much information. In addition, participants might arrive to the program with information overload related to the covered health topic. Information overload about health topics has been shown to influence attitudes and behavioral intentions. The overall purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between mental health information overload, topic interest, and care seeking recommendations.

Design/methodology/approach
The current study tested a path suggesting high mental health information overload diminishes interest in learning about mental health, which in turn reduces recommendations to others to seek appropriate help when in need. Participants completed online measures of mental health information overload, topic interest and recommendations for care seeking. The data set analyzed represents valid responses from 221 participants. Structural equation modeling was completed to confirm the path model hypothesized for this study.

Findings
Structural equation modeling showed satisfactory fit and significant betas for the hypothesized path.

Originality/value
This study adds to the emerging literature on the impact of health information overload and is the first to the best of the authors’ knowledge to measure mental health information overload. Program developers should consider information overload in the ongoing development of public mental health education programs.

INFORMATION OVERLOAD: THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AREA

Key takeaways:Information overload is a psychological phenomenon affecting individuals' mental health and professional efficiency, with solutions requiring media literacy and personal self-efficacy.

Abstract:Among the variety of synonymously similar scientific concepts used in psychological research (cognitive overload, sensory overload, knowledge overload, information fatigue syndrome, cognitive information load, information overload, cognitive load), we chose the concept of 'information overload' for categorical analysis, because it defines the most holistically and complete the corresponding psychological phenomenon, meaningfully reflecting and naming significant realities. The essential signs of this phenomenon are: the external one – 'what caused the state of tension' (informational message) – and the internal one - 'what mental state appears as a result' (overload). Information overload is defined as a state of an individual's mental stress caused by received excessive information messages; this excessiveness is experienced subjectively as a stressful situation associated with worsened efficiency of the individual's cognitive mental processes and causes a mental protective blocking of high-quality deep intellectual processing of incoming information and its transformation into full-fledged personal knowledge.

Number of 

Key takeaways:SNS users with secure and dismissing attachment styles experience lower levels of perceived information overload and SNS fatigue, while fearful styles experience increased levels of both.

Abstract:ABSTRACT This study examined the effects of SNS users’ perceived information overload on SNS fatigue and mental health, highlighting the influence of users’ attachment styles. Also, the mediating role of SNS fatigue in the association between perceived information overload and mental health was investigated. Using data from a national sample in South Korea (N = 635), the study found that those in the secure style (n = 216) and the dismissing style (n = 134) showed low levels of perceived information overload and SNS fatigue than those in the preoccupied style (n = 143) and the fearful style (n = 160). These results uncovered that the anxiety dimension of attachment styles was the differentiating factor for the variables in the study. Moreover, the study supported the mediating role of SNS fatigue in the three attachments styles except for the fearful style. Theoretical implications and contributions of the study were also discussed.

Key takeaways:This review reveals a wide range of interventions and design approaches to address information overload, but the strength of evidence from these studies is mixed.

Abstract:Information overload is a problem that is being exacerbated by the ongoing digitalization of the world of work and the growing use of information and communication technologies. Therefore, the aim of this systematic literature review is to provide an insight into existing measures for prevention and intervention related to information overload. The methodological approach of the systematic review is based on the PRISMA standards. A keyword search in three interdisciplinary scientific databases and other more practice-oriented databases resulted in the identification of 87 studies, field reports, and conceptual papers that were included in the review. The results show that a considerable number of papers have been published on interventions on the behavioral prevention level. At the level of structural prevention, there are also many proposals on how to design work to reduce information overload. A further distinction can be made between work design approaches at the level of information and communication technology and at the level of teamwork and organizational regulations. Although the identified studies cover a wide range of possible interventions and design approaches to address information overload, the strength of the evidence from these studies is mixed.

Information overload within the health care system: a literature review.

Number of 

Key takeaways:The literature on information overload in healthcare is limited, with solutions mainly focusing on technological means rather than human involvement in managing or filtering information.

Abstract:There is a widespread view held by health clinicians that their work effectiveness is impaired by 'information overload.' Building upon a previous work by Wilson, a review of the literature was undertaken to look for the evidence of this. It was found that the literature, particularly in the context of the clinical environment, was limited. This review explores the diverse overarching theories of information overload, effects of the phenomenon that are perceived to occur and proposed solutions to this problem. Many of the papers noted an information explosion but only three authors explicitly attempted to measure both the quantity and the complexity of this information. It was also found that the typology of the information studied was severely limited with most studies exploring information such as guidelines, access to journals, research findings and other knowledge intensive areas. Solutions proposed seem to concentrate on technological means rather than exploring the use of humans either in management of information or as a step in the filtering process.

Information Overload: An Introduction

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload is a serious issue that can be managed through coping strategies, better design of information systems, and promoting digital and media literacies.

Abstract:For almost as long as there has been recorded information, there has been a perception that humanity has been overloaded by it. Concerns about “too much to read” have been expressed for many centuries, and made more urgent since the arrival of ubiquitous digital information in the late 20th century. The historical perspective is a necessary corrective to the often, and wrongly, held view that it is associated solely with the modern digital information environment and with social media in particular. However, as society fully experiences Floridi’s Fourth Revolution, and moves into hyper-history (with society dependent on, and defined by, information and communication technologies) and the infosphere (an information environment distinguished by a seamless blend of online and offline information activity), individuals and societies are dependent on and formed by information in an unprecedented way, and information overload needs to be taken more seriously than ever.
 Overload has been claimed to be both the major issue of our time and a complete nonissue. It has, as will be noted later, been noted as an important factor in many areas, including politics and governance. It has been cited as an important factor in a wide range of areas, from business to literature.
 The information overload phenomenon has been known by many different names, including: information overabundance, infobesity, infoglut, data smog, information pollution, information fatigue, social media fatigue, social media overload, information anxiety, library anxiety, infostress, infoxication, reading overload, communication overload, cognitive overload, information violence, and information assault. There is no single generally accepted definition, but it can best be understood as the situation that arises when there is so much relevant and potentially useful information available that it becomes a hindrance rather than a help. Its essential nature has not changed with evolving technology, although its causes and proposed solutions have changed significantly.
 The best ways of avoiding overload, individually and socially, appear to lie in a variety of coping strategies, such as filtering, withdrawing, queuing, and “satisficing.” Better design of information systems, effective personal information management, and the promotion of digital and media literacies also have a part to play. Overload may perhaps best be overcome by seeking a mindful balance in consuming information and in finding understanding.

Patient Safety Issues From Information Overload in Electronic Medical Records

Key takeaways:Information overload in electronic health records may lead to higher error rates and negatively impact patient safety.

Abstract:Background and Objective Electronic health records (EHRs) have become ubiquitous in medicine and continue to grow in informational content. Little has been documented regarding patient safety from the resultant information overload. The objective of this literature review is to better understand how information overload in EHR affects patient safety. Methods A literature search was performed using the Transparent Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards for literature review. PubMed and Web of Science were searched and articles selected that were relevant to EHR information overload based on keywords. Results The literature search yielded 28 articles meeting the criteria for the study. Information overload was found to increase physician cognitive load and error rates in clinical simulations. Overabundance of clinically irrelevant information, poor data display, and excessive alerting were consistently identified as issues that may lead to information overload. Conclusions Information overload in EHRs may result in higher error rates and negatively impact patient safety. Further studies are necessary to define the role of EHR in adverse patient safety events and to determine methods to mitigate these errors. Changes focused on the usability of EHR should be considered with the end user (physician) in mind. Federal agencies have a role to play in encouraging faster adoption of improved EHR interfaces.

Key takeaways:Under cognitive overload, the brain prioritizes spatial memory functions, leading to restricted resources for subsequent spatial information processing.

Abstract:The impact of excessive cognitive workload on personal work and life is widely recognized, yet the brain information processing mechanisms under cognitive overload remain unclear. This study employed a spatial configuration task, combined with time-varying brain network analysis and source localization techniques based on electroencephalography signals, to delve into the dynamic adjustment processes of the brain among healthy participants during cognitive overload. The results revealed that under cognitive overload, the overall activation level of the brain significantly decreases, with characteristics of delayed responses. Further analysis indicated that under overload, the brain network connectivity in the right hemisphere brain networks closely associated with spatial object recognition and localization was weakened. In contrast, the brain network connections between the left hemisphere are enhanced. These changes suggest that during cognitive overload, the brain prioritizes resource allocation to support spatial memory functions, which might lead to restricted resources for subsequent spatial information processing. Notably, the significant differences in brain network connectivity observed in the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus make them important potential markers for identifying cognitive overload states during spatial configuration tasks. This study provides a fresh perspective and scientific foundation for understanding the impact of cognitive overload on work performance.

Key takeaways:Information overload occurs when the amount or intensity of information exceeds an individual's limited capacity for cognitive processing, leading to inefficient work, confusion, and stress.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION
We are living in the time of greatest dissemination of information in the history of the human race, and this excess of information has resulted in considering human attention as a scarce resource. Information overload is the situation in which the amount or intensity of information exceeds the individual's limited capacity for cognitive processing.

OBJECTIVE
To describe the concept of information overload, its possible neurocognitive substrates, associated symptoms, causes, measures to avoid it, as well as its possible relationship with the internet and electronic devices.

DEVELOPMENT
People respond differently to information overload, and this depends on individual factors as well as on the amount and characteristics of the informative stimulation. Some symptoms of information overload are: inefficient work, confusion, delay in making decisions, lack of critical evaluation of information, loss of control over information, refusal to receive communication, lack of general perspective, greater tolerance for error, anxiety, stress, etc. The limits of information processing capacity are probably conditioned by the limited metabolic energy that is distributed in the brain and remains constant regardless of the difficulty of the tasks.

CONCLUSION
Attention is a limited cognitive function. In order to reduce the adverse effects of information overload, it is necessary to improve the personal management of our own cognitive resources and to understand their relationship with technology. Likewise, it is necessary to improve the handling of information through the organization, filtering and application of cognitive ergonomics design guidelines.

Antecedents and Consequences of Information Overload in the COVID-19 Pandemic

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload during the COVID-19 pandemic is influenced by cognitive capacity, online news use, and interpersonal communication, leading to heuristic processing and less systematic processing.

Abstract:The global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 2020 has significantly affected the information environment as well as the daily life of individuals across the world, with information about COVID-19 dominating all media channels. The information provided at the time of a health crisis like COVID-19 is critical in helping people learn about the disease and the recommendations to prevent infection. However, studies have shown that when people are overwhelmed by too much information (referred to as ‘information overload’), this leads to adverse effects. This study examined the antecedents and consequences of information overload in the context of COVID-19. A survey was conducted among 627 residents in Seoul, South Korea, one of the earliest affected countries in the global outbreak. The results showed that cognitive capacity and the frequency of online news use and interpersonal communication were significant predictors of information overload. Information overload influenced how information is processed; it was associated with the tendency toward greater heuristic processing and less systematic processing. In addition, people were more likely to enact prevention behaviors when the information was processed systematically, as opposed to heuristically. The results are discussed considering both the theoretical and practical implications.

How Does Information Overload Affect Consumers’ Online Decision Process? An Event-Related Potentials Study

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload leads to worse decision quality and experience, with consumers spending more time making decisions, investing less attentional resources, and experiencing more decision process regret.

Abstract:One of the advantages of e-retailers is their capability to provide a large amount of information to consumers. However, when the amount of information exceeds consumers’ information processing capacities, it will lead to worse decision quality and experience, causing the information overload effect. In this study, the event-related potentials (ERPs) were applied to examine the hidden neural mechanism of the impact of information overload on consumers’ decision processes. Behavioral data showed that people would spend more time making decisions when faced with information overload. Neurophysiologically, consumers would invest less attentional resources in the high amount of information (HAI) condition than those in the low amount of information (LAI) condition and lead to less positive P2 amplitudes. The HAI condition would increase decision difficulty than would the LAI condition and result in smaller P3 amplitudes. In addition, an increased late positive component (LPC) was observed for the HAI condition in contrast to the LAI condition, indicating that consumers were more inclined to have decision process regret when consumers were overloaded. We further investigated the dynamic information processing when consumers got over information overload by mining the brain’s time-varying networks. The results revealed that during the decision process and the neural response stage, the central area controlled other brain regions’ activities for the HAI condition, suggesting that people may still consider and compare other important information after the decision process when faced with information overload. In general, this study may provide neural evidence of how information overload affects consumers’ decision processes and ultimately damages decision quality.

Key takeaways:Information overload can negatively impact health and sleep, with solutions including limiting screen time, consuming less content, and maintaining good sleep hygiene.

Abstract:Due to the processes of globalization and transition to the information society their negative effects started to become apparent, namely virtually unlimited access to an abundance of information. Information overload occurs when the amount of information exceeds the perceptual abilities of accepting human being. It questions the impact of this process on health and sleep. Such phenomena as mind scrolling, communicative overload, distrust of digital security, cyber violence, digital inequality as mediators or consequences of information overload are considered. This article reviews the types of the information overload, ways of disseminating information, mechanisms of influence on the self-rated health and psychological condition and sleep, connections with anxiety and depression. This subject became especially relevant in  the context of  COVID-19 pandemic, since isolation, restriction of motor activity, and increased time spent behind the screen have become important predictors not only of sleep disorders, but also of other health problems. The article addresses the issue of subjects of studies are usually teenagers and people under 35 (generation Z), as the most active smartphones, messengers, social networks and mass media users. The problem of providing unfair information to users of social networks of different regions of residence, socio-economic levels is raised. Most scientists agree that the ways to solve the described problems are to limit the time behind the screen, the amount of content consumed per day, and compliance with sleep hygiene.

Key takeaways:Information overload in technologically advanced societies can lead to cognitive impairment, unpleasant feelings, and increased susceptibility to physical and psychiatric disorders.

Abstract:preventive action as do air and water pollution’ , Lipowski concluded. Increasing the information input beyond the person’s capacity is one of the major factors contributing to subjectively perceived job pressure and dissatisfaction. The condition of overload is by no means always imposed by external factors, but may be self-induced. Overcommitment was defined by Lipowski as ‘a state of role and information overload due in part to unwillingness or inability to set limits to one’s pursuit of activities rewarded by approval, success, promotion, money and other inducements that bolster self-esteem’ (p. 209). The social environment offers abundant opportunities and rewards for ceaseless striving. The academic field provides an excellent example of the interaction between personality and social factors in producing overcommitment. Finally, affluent societies expose their members to an overabundance of stimuli capable of arousing attractiveness as a result of an economic system striving for creation of ever-new wants. Yet, economic and/or time constraints prevent many from responding to attractive stimuli by goal-directed action and consummation. Maladaptive coping strategies to this attractive stimulus overload may ensue . Lipowski anticipated trends and phenomena which have become more and more evident in the following decades. Surprisingly, however, the scientific interest, whether medical or psychological or management related, in the concept of information overload has not grown proportionally . In particular, society then did not have the widespread diffusion of the meta-medium, the computer, which poIn 1974, Lipowski , in this journal, attempted to outline a connection between the conditions of sensory and information overload in technologically advanced societies and individual vulnerability to behavioral and medical disturbances. His hypothesis was that each individual has a characteristic optimal level of stimulus or information output which allows him or her to be comfortable and to perform efficiently. Affluent, technological societies provide an unprecedented range of stimulus conditions which for many people result in subjective overload. These conditions include urbanization, certain occupations, traffic jams, media messages, and a vast number of novel, ambiguous and attractive information outputs. Information overload may result in excessive cortical and autonomic arousal, which may predispose to or precipitate cognitive impairment, unpleasant feeling tone, and, possibly, contribute to a general susceptibility to both physical and psychiatric disorders . In a subsequent paper, Lipowski further elaborated the clinical domains of this research field. Crowding, an experiential state resulting from the interaction of high physical density, interference with ongoing activities, individual differences in personal space, frequency and duration of exposure, may result in subjective discomfort, social disorganization and sustained or repeated physiological arousal that may contribute to human morbidity, particularly to cardiovascular diseases . Noise, one of the main sources of sensory overload for city dwellers and for a substantial proportion of industrial workers, may induce feelings of annoyance and irritability. ‘Noise pollution of our environment deserves as much research and

Exploring information avoidance intention of social media users: a cognition-affect-conation perspective

Number of 

Key takeaways:Perceived information overload leads to increased fatigue, frustration, and dissatisfaction among social media users, leading to information avoidance intentions.

Abstract:Grounded on the cognition–affect–conation (C–A–C) framework, this study aims to explore how perceived information overload affects the information avoidance intention of social media users through fatigue, frustration and dissatisfaction.,A quantitative research design is adopted. The data collected from 254 respondents in China are analyzed via structural equation modeling (SEM).,Perceived information overload directly affects fatigue, frustration and dissatisfaction among social media users, thereby affecting their information avoidance intention. In addition, frustration significantly affects social media fatigue and dissatisfaction. Consequently, social media fatigue influences dissatisfaction among users.,The literature review indicates that social media overload and fatigue yield negative behavioral outcomes, including discontinuance. However, rather than completely abstaining or escaping, social media users adopt moderate strategies, including information avoidance, to cope with overload and fatigue owing to their high dependence on social media. Unfortunately, merely few studies are available on the information avoidance behavior of social media users. Focusing on this line of research, the current study develops a model to investigate the antecedents of information avoidance in social media.

Information Overload in Patient Education: A Wilsonian Concept Analysis

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload in patient education is a complex issue affecting stress and self-care performance, and healthcare providers should recognize its impact on patients.

Abstract:The authors of this concept analysis seek to clarify the concept of information overload within the context of patient education in healthcare. A modified six-step Wilsonian concept analysis method with a review of qualified manuscripts from PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and MEDLINE from 2000 to 2018 was conducted. Information overload occurs when an individual acknowledges that information received is beyond his or her information-absorbing threshold. The causes include quantity and quality of the information and information delivery structures. Information overload is associated with higher levels of stress and poor self-care performance. It is significant for healthcare providers to recognize patients’ feelings of information overload.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload occurs due to the finite capacity of human cognition to effectively process increasing amounts of information in everyday life.

Abstract:The amount of information available to people is growing rapidly, and the rate of scientific publications is growing exponentially. This means that people have to deal with more and more information in their everyday life. It is therefore not surprising that many people have experienced what is commonly referred to as information overload, with the associated sensation of being swamped. Information overload occurs because the degree to which we can effectively process information is limited by the finite capacity of human cognition.

A meta-analysis on the relation between information overload, behavior, and experience.

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload negatively impacts people's behavior and experience, leading to information avoidance, burnout, and fatigue, and negatively impacting performance and satisfaction in both work and home contexts.

Abstract:This quantitative meta-analysis provides insights into the relation between information overload (IO) and peoples’ behavior and experience, such as information avoidance, lowered performance, negative impacts on well-being and physical health. We analyzed the data of 94.073 employees, managers, students, and mixed samples within 81 studies and overall, 251 effect sizes. We performed multi-level as well as robust variance estimation analyses and found positive correlations between IO and information avoidance (z = .29 ), burnout and fatigue (z = .48 ), and negative correlations between IO and performance (z = -.20 ) and satisfaction (z = -.26 ), as well as on other outcomes. Explorative moderator analyses revealed different moderating effects based on sample nationality or vocational setting. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis indicate a negative relationship between IO and peoples’ behavior and experience, which call for an evaluation of the exchange and handling of information. Across a wide range of studies and contexts, this meta-analysis reveals that IO provokes the information fatigue syndrome that has been poorly considered to date, leading to severe consequences in both work and home contexts.

Correlates of Cancer Information Overload: Focusing on Individual Ability and Motivation

Number of 

Key takeaways:Cancer information overload is partly influenced by individual ability and motivation, with trait anxiety, active media use, and family history being key factors.

Abstract:Abstract The present study defined cancer information overload (CIO) as an aversive disposition wherein a person is confused and overwhelmed by cancer information, which occurs when he or she fails to effectively categorize new information due to a lack of resources for effective learning. Based on the definition and informed by previous studies on information overload and the cognitive mediation model, we hypothesized that low ability and motivation to process cancer information would lead to CIO. We used education level and trait anxiety as factors related to ability. Cancer history and the use of active media channels (such as the Internet and print media) were adopted as motivational factors. Four samples (three from the United States and one from South Korea) were used to explore the relationship between ability/motivation and CIO. Among them, only Sample 4 participants answered questions about stomach cancer, and other participants were asked about cancer in general. In all four samples, trait anxiety was positively associated with CIO. Health information use from active media channels (print or the Internet) was negatively associated with CIO in three samples. The associations between family history and CIO, and between education and CIO, were found in two samples. In short, the present study demonstrated that CIO partly depends on individual ability and motivation, thereby showing that CIO is influenced by personal characteristics as well as environmental factors.

How college students’ social media information overload affects sleep quality: The mediating effect of social fatigue and irrational procrastination

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload in college students negatively impacts sleep quality through social fatigue and irrational procrastination.

Abstract:Information overload is a pervasive phenomenon in the information age and has a negative impact on personal psychological experiences and behavioural performance. The relationship between WeChat information overload and sleep quality was examined, as well as the mediating effects of social fatigue and irrational procrastination. A total of 1 899 Chinese college students (females = 45.8%; mean age = 20.26 years, SD = 1.70) were selected for study. They completed the Information Overload Scale, Social Fatigue Scale, Irrational Procrastination Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Path analysis results show a significantly positive correlation between information overload and sleep quality and the mediating role of irrational procrastination in this relationship. Social fatigue and irrational procrastination play a chain-mediating role in the link between information overload and sleep quality. This suggests that information overload has an impact on sleep quality through social fatigue and irrational procrastination. Student mental health counselling services should consider information overload and sleep deprivation indicators for support interventions.

Information Poverty or Overload?

Number of 

Key takeaways:Information overload, or information fatigue syndrome, can paralyze individuals, preventing them from taking action and potentially leading to the same fate as the information poor.

Abstract:Although the issue of the divide separating the information rich from the information poor tends to be thought of in terms of the distinction between developed and developing countries, there exists a comparable dichotomy within developed countries separating those with easy access to an abundance of information and those with little or no access. However, the enormous efforts being made to find solutions to this problem in the UK, at various levels of local and national government and particularly in the field of citizenship information, is tending to make available more information than citizens can easily assimilate. The serious nature of this information overload problem has led to the coining of the term ”information fatigue syndrome” (IFS), said to cause paralysis of the analytical capacity, constant searches for more information, increased anxiety and sleeplessness and self-doubt in decision making. It is concluded that those suffering from information overload or IFS are at risk of suffering the same fate as the information poor. The information poor are unable to take action because they do not have necessary information that would enable them to take control. The information rich are similarly paralyzed because of their inability to create order from all the information washing over them. It may be necessary to think in terms of the information rich, the information poor and information burdened.

Association between Role Overload and Sleep Disturbance among Dementia Caregivers: The Impact of Social Support and Social Engagement

Number of 

Key takeaways:Role overload is associated with sleep disturbances in dementia caregivers, and increasing instrumental support may improve their sleep quality.

Abstract:Objective: To explore the association between role overload (RO) and sleep maintenance insomnia (SMI), and the moderation effects of social support and social engagement (SE). Methods: We report a cross-sectional study using data drawn from the 2015 National Health and Aging Trends Study and National Study of Caregiving. We used multiple regression and controlled for demographics and potential confounders. Results: Nearly 45% of caregivers reported suffering from SMI during “some” and “more” nights within the past month with one half reporting “almost” or “every” night. RO was found positively associated with the risk of SMI. Instrumental support moderated the effect of RO on SMI overall, although moderation was limited to a subsample of adult children caregivers. Discussion: The sleep quality of dementia caregivers may be affected by RO, particularly for adult children caregivers. Increasing instrumental support may be beneficial to caregiver's sleep quality.

Key takeaways:Sleep deprivation impairs the binding of information to its context, potentially impacting memory tasks and decision-making.

Abstract:Binding information to its context in long-term memory is critical for many tasks, including memory tasks and decision making. Failure to associate information to its context could be an important aspect of sleep deprivation effects on cognition, but little is known about binding problems from being sleep-deprived at the time of encoding. We studied how sleep deprivation affects binding using a well-established paradigm testing the ability to remember auditorily presented words (items) and their speakers (

Dynamic hippocampal functional connectivity responses to varying working memory loads following total sleep deprivation

Number of 

Key takeaways:Increased working memory load after total sleep deprivation disrupts memory processes, and the brain reacts dynamically and flexible, involving brain activation and hippocampus-related functional network connections.

Abstract:Sleep loss with work overload can impact human cognitive performance. However, the brain's response to an increased working memory load following total sleep deprivation (TSD) remains unclear. In the present study, we focussed on the dynamic response of the hippocampus to increased working memory load before and after total sleep deprivation of 36 h. A total of 16 male participants completed a verbal working memory task under functional magnetic resonance imaging. After whole‐brain activation analysis and region of interest analysis of the hippocampus, the generalised form of context‐dependent psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) was used to analyse the hippocampal functional connectivity with the whole brain. The results revealed that as the working memory load increased within a small range, from 0‐back to 1‐back task, the left hippocampal functional connectivity decreased with the left supplementary motor area, left pars opercularis, left rolandic operculum, right superior frontal gyrus, bilateral precentral gyrus, and left middle cingulate cortex following total sleep deprivation compared with that observed in resting wakefulness. When the working memory load further increased from 1‐back to 2‐back task, the connectivity increased between the left hippocampus and the left superior parietal lobule as well as between the left hippocampus and right lingual gyrus after total sleep deprivation compared with that observed in resting wakefulness. Moreover, the left hippocampus gPPI effect on the left middle cingulate cortex and left superior parietal lobule could predict the behavioural test accuracy in 1‐back and 2‐back task, respectively, following total sleep deprivation. These findings indicated that increased working memory load after total sleep deprivation disrupts working memory processes. The brain reacts to these disruptions in a dynamic and flexible manner, involving not only brain activation but also hippocampus‐related functional network connections.

Perspectives on Information Overload

Number of 

Key takeaways:The information overload research paradigm has limited ability to capture and model the real world, and its use in applied settings has been questioned by various researchers.

Abstract:T he notion of information overload has received a fair measure of attention in the consumer behavior literature. Early research on the phenomenon (Jacoby 1974; Jacoby, Kohn, and Speller 1973; Jacoby, Speller, and Berning 1974; Jacoby, Speller, and Kohn 1974) suggested that there could be dysfunctional consequences resulting from providing consumers with 'too much' information. These studies soon spawned critics (Russo 1974; Summers 1974; Wilkie 1974), rejoinders (Jacoby 1977; Jacoby, Speller, and Beming 1975) and additional empirical work (Scammon 1977; Staelin and Payne 1976). While the critics raised a variety of technical issues regarding the empirical procedures employed (e.g., what are the best ways to operationalize information and decision quality, should one correct for guessing as a function of the number of brands available, and so on), Jacoby was perhaps his own severest critic. This occurred primarily in two articles which appear to have attracted negligible attention and which, when cited, seem not to be recognized as the fundamental critiques that they are. The first paper (Jacoby 1975) begins by summarizing the results of several additional overload studies (including some conducted outside of the U.S. and others involving authentic subject motivation-that is, test situations in which the consumer actually kept the product selected), all of which seemed to confirm an overload effect and most of which were likely to have been

Key takeaways:Information overload can lead to poor decisions and reduced job productivity, but it may be possible to discover new things faster than scouring the web for facts.

Abstract:WHEN Alvin Toffler coined the term 'information overload' in his classic 1970 book, Future Shock, it is doubtful that even he imagined the formidable array of information sources that we now have access to. Speculation quickly surfaced that such an information supply could lead to poor decisions as the capacity of our human processing ability becomes taxed. Research has established that job productivity and performance can be severely reduced due to excessive information and the intrusion of data sources into our lives. Could it be that we will reach a time when it is quicker to discover something from scratch than from facts we can sort out from a library or the web?
